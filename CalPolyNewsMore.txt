                       CAL POLY POMONA PHYSICS CHAIR TRAINS  
            U.S. PHYSICS TEAM BEFORE INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION 
        
       The United States Physics Team, consisting of five high school Newtons-in-training, 

were at Cal Poly Pomona from July 28-30 to prepare for the upcoming 34th International Physics 

Olympiad Competition in Taipei, Taiwan, from Aug. 2-11.    

       The students worked under the guidance of academic director Mary Mogge, physics chair 

at Cal Poly Pomona, and other coaches. Mogge has coached the team since 1996.  

       Its very rewarding working with these students, said Mogge, who will escort the 

students to the competition. They really keep us busy and challenge us as coaches because 

theyre so bright. Its people like these who will go on to do great things like win Nobel prizes 

and find cures to illnesses.  

       While at Cal Poly Pomona, the physics team worked in the university labs as they 

prepared for the intense nine-day international competition among pre-university students from 

more than 60 nations. The United States physics team was chosen from the 1,400 best high 

school physics scholars in the nation.  

       Cal Poly Pomona is located at 3801 W. Temple Ave. in Pomona. Daily parking permits 

are required, and can be purchased for $4 at the Visitor Information Booth along Kellogg Drive.

           SIMULATED FIRE IN CAL POLY POMONA RESIDENCE HALL TO  
                   TEST AND ENHANCE EMERGENCY PROCEDURES  
 
          Who:   Cal Poly Pomona and Engine 187 of Los Angeles County Fire Department 
                  Batallion 19.  

         What:   The university and its first responding fire engine company will be testing 
                  their emergency planning with a fire drill. In the scenario, a fire will engulf a 
                  three-story residence hall after a student falls asleep with a candle burning. 
                  Smoke will fill the hallways as students scramble to escape, including one 
                  who will jump from a third floor window. Through the assistance of theater 
                  student Kelly Norris, a number of volunteers will be fitted with makeup and 
                  prosthetics to simulate burns, cuts and other injuries.  

         When:   Monday, Aug. 18. Preparations begin at 9 a.m. The residence hall will catch 
                  fire about 10 a.m. 

        Where:   Aliso Hall (off University Drive) 

          Why:  The exercise benefits both the university and the local fire engine company 
                  by ensuring that emergency procedures are up-to-date and accurate.

     W.K. KELLOGG FOUNDATION GRANT TO FUND FIRST-TIME EXPANSION  
                  OF CAL POLY POMONAS ARABIAN HORSE CENTER 
        
       Cal Poly Pomonas W.K. Kellogg Arabian Horse Center will have new three barns and fencing 
thanks to a $173,890 grant from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. Construction is expected to begin in 
August and finish early October, said Center director Bill Hughes. The new barns, which will be built 
behind the existing facility, will be the first additions to the center since its opening in 1974. 
       One barn will be used for hay and shavings and will reduce the amount of lost shavings and hay 
due to weather conditions. Another will serve as a mare and foal barn where the horses can give birth. 
The third will be a student-boarding barn  capable of housing up to 20 horses for students involved in 
the equine program who wish to keep their horses on campus.  
       We have a long list of students who want to bring their horses to the university that are involved 
in all the equine programs, Hughes said. These upgrades will help us provide more up-to-date facilities 
we can use to help our students. 
       Students are crucial to the Center. Often working as employees in the daily maintenance of the 
Center and care of the animals, they also participate in activities ranging from the mounted drill team, 
horse show team and rodeo association. 
       When W.K. Kellogg donated his land, one of the provisions was that the Arabian horse shows 
continue. Along with continuing the traditional shows, the Center houses more than 80 purebred 
Arabian horses and is dedicated to education, outreach and research. The center is internationally 
recognized for its breeding and training programs.

   REAL ESTATE RESEARCH COUNCIL LUNCHEON WILL FEATURE BRUCE NORRIS, 
  WHO ACCURATELY PREDICTED THE DOUBLING OF CALIFORNIA HOUSING COSTS  
   
         Who:   Bruce Norris, president of The Norris Group, will be the featured speaker at the 
                 upcoming quarterly meeting of the Real Estate Research Council of Southern 
                 California (RERC). With 18 years of experience in property acquisition, negotiation, 
                 sales and management, Norris has lead seminars for Realtor boards and private 
                 investors. The Norris Group is dedicated to the profitability and education of 
                 California real estate investors. 
        When:   Thursday, Aug. 28, 11:30 a.m. to 1:40 p.m. 
       Where:   Cal Poly Pomonas Kellogg West Conference Center 
        What:   This quarterly luncheon meeting of the RERC will include release of its second 
                 quarter 2003 Real Estate and Construction Report, with executive director Michael 
                 Carney presenting an update on trends through the second quarter including the 
                 results of the survey of unsold new tract housing inventory. 
         Why:  The RERC is a nonprofit organization based at Cal Poly Pomona. It works toward 
                 developing and distributing factual information about conditions affecting real estate 
                 in Southern California, from housing to mortgage lending and construction.  
Opportunity:    This is a chance for the media to hear first-hand from Norris what real estate trends 
                 he sees. Norris predicts that home prices will rise by 25 percent in the next 18 
                 months. At a 1997 RERC meeting, Norris anticipated that California home prices 
                 would double in 8 years. They doubled in 6 ½. The RERC quarterly meeting is open 
                 to members, guests, media and others interested in the work of the council. Cost is 
                 $35 and includes lunch. Reservations are required.

      CAL POLY POMONA PHYSICS CHAIR HELPS GUIDE U.S. PHYSICS TEAM  
                 TO TOP HONORS AT INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION 
        
       The 2003 United States Physics Team, coached by Cal Poly Pomona physics chair Mary 
Mogge, won five medals and four special prizes at the 34th International Physics Olympiad 
Competition in Taipei, Taiwan, from Aug. 2-11. Mogge, who is the teams academic director, 
accompanied the five high school students to the competition along with another coach. 
       Working with the U.S. team gives me a great sense of satisfaction, says Mogge, who 
has coached the team since 1996. The students are the brightest of the bright and Im doing 
something to help and encourage them. 
       Pre-university students from nearly 60 nations participated in the intense nine-day 
international competition. The U.S. Physics Team was chosen from the 1,400 best high school 
physics scholars in the nation. 
       In preparation for the competition, the team participated in a mini-camp devoted to 
enhancing their laboratory skills from July 28-30 at Cal Poly Pomona. 
       The International Physics Olympiad required the students to take a five-hour theoretical 
exam, which included problems that featured a swing with a falling weight; piezoelectric quartz 
crystal; and a two-part problem that dealt with special relativity and the power of a laser. In 
addition, an experimental competition required students to measure properties of laser diodes and 
liquid crystal cells. 
       Of the 238 students competing, U.S. team members were awarded first prize, best score 
in experiment, best score in theory and best female participant. Three members received gold 
medals and two received silver medals. All five U.S. students placed in the top 10 percent.

                these patterns, form from the effects life experiences have on us. They are 
                sometimes influenced by ideology or theology, but are rooted in the act of 
                being in our bodies in the world. The challenge of wearing a body is in 
                determining what develops through interface with other people and through 
                personal discovery. The artist's perception is that time and experience does 
                alter the body and that the face becomes a roadmap to the psyche. It is this 
                subtle expression of personalitymomentary and essentialthat is the goal 
                of her work.  

                The use of clay as a primary medium reflects her sense of connection to the 
                imagery of the mask and the body. She uses high fire sculpture clay and 
                glazes for texture and visual depth. All of these involve physical interaction, 
                time and change.

             CAL POLY POMONA SELECTS CLAREMONT RESIDENT AS  
       2003 RECIPIENT OF OUTSTANDING FACULTY LEADERSHIP AWARD 
 
       Sociology professor Gary Allen Cretser has been named recipient of the George P. Hart 

Award for Outstanding Faculty Leadership for 2003-04. A Claremont resident, Cretser will 

receive his award on Monday, Sept. 22, during the universitys Fall Conference Convocation. 

       The Hart Award, now in its eighth year, recognizes faculty members who are regarded as 

role models and leaders, both on campus and in the community.  

       Gary Cretser is an outstanding individual. My colleagues agree that he is compassionate, 

fair-minded, intellectually stimulating, a solid scholar and an able administrator, says sociology 

professor Wayne Wooden. Hes the kind of professor that years after one has graduated from 

this university, a student will remember with fondness  there is no better testament than that. 

       Cretser has taught at Cal Poly Pomona since 1966, taking on many additional capacities 

at the university and within the Cal State system. Currently department chair of behavioral 

sciences, other positions he has held include resident director of the CSU International Programs 

in Sweden and Denmark, and acting director of International Programs and the International 

Center at Cal Poly Pomona. Cretser has been a senator and committee chair on the Academic 

Senate. He is a professional member of several educational associations including Phi Beta 

Delta, an international honor society in which he has served as national president (1989-90) and 

now vice president for the western region. 

       Cretsers leadership roles and volunteer work stretch beyond the CSU. He has 

participated as a consultant on eight projects affecting the broader community, including work 

with residential care facilities, fire departments, the California Office of Traffic Safety and the 

California Institution for Men in Chino.

    MOTHER OF MATTHEW SHEPARD TO DISCUSS VIOLENCE PREVENTION  

       AS PART OF CAL POLY POMONA DISTINGUISHED LECTURE SERIES 
 
       Five years ago, 21-year-old Matthew Shepards death at the hands of homophobes sparked 
vigils, rallies and discussions nationwide. On the anniversary of the day that the University of 
Wyoming student was found strapped to a fence, beaten and tortured, his mother will speak at Cal 
Poly Pomona about the lasting legacy of hope and compassion he leaves behind.  
       The public is welcome to attend the free event, scheduled for Tuesday,  Oct. 7, at 6 p.m. in 
the Bronco Student Centers Ursa Major Suite.  
       Matthew Shepard left a bar with two strangers on Oct. 6, 1998, and was found gravely 
wounded the next evening. He died five days later on Oct. 12. Shepards ordeal captivated the nation, 
inspiring three television movies and an acclaimed play.  
       His mother, Judy Shepard, will discuss the vital need for violence prevention and offer steps 
individuals can take to make schools and communities safer for everyone. The lecture is a part of 
Lesbian, Gay, Bi-Sexual and Transgender History Month at Cal Poly Pomona. Another featured 
event of the month, the annual Clothesline Project and Hate Crime Memorial, will coincide with the 
lecture. They will be on display Oct. 7, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., in University Park.  
       This special event is made possible through Cal Poly Pomonas Distinguished Lecture Series, 
the Pride Center, Associated Students Inc., Office of Student Life & Cultural Centers, Stop the 
Violence Grant Office, University Housing Services, Cal Poly Pomona Foundation Housing 
Services, Counseling & Psychological Services and Student Health Services.

       The recipients of Cal Poly Pomonas prestigious Presidents Council Scholarships will 

receive their awards from university President J. Michael Ortiz on Wednesday, Oct. 1. 

       All of the recipients hail from Southern California and represent each of the academic 

colleges of Agriculture; Business Administration; Education & Integrative Studies; 

Environmental Design; Letters, Arts & Social Sciences; Science; and The Collins School of 

Hospitality Management.   

       Of the 23 Presidents Council Scholars, 19 are undergraduates and four are graduate 

students.   

       Founded in 1983, the President's Council Scholars program awards a select group of 

students each year based on academic and co-curricular excellence rather than need.    

       Recipients must have a minimum GPA of 3.5 and demonstrate significant contributions 

to the community during their high school and university years.  Each of the endowed 

scholarships is named by its benefactor and provides a $1,500 award for the recipient. 

       The Presidents Council is a group of prominent business and community leaders who 

have a dedicated history of public service and serve as liaisons to the university.

                    MONTH-LONG EVENTS AT CAL POLY POMONA  
          SCHEDULED TO DRAW ATTENTION TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
 
       The American Medical Association estimates that more than 4 million women are victims 
of severe assaults by boyfriends or husbands each year. That grim statistic doesnt include 
children and men who are also affected by abuse in the home. To help empower victims of 
domestic violence, Cal Poly Pomona is taking part in national Domestic Violence Awareness 
Month in October. The following events are open to the public:  
        
       Clothesline Project and Hate Crime Memorial  
       A hate crime memorial and the Clothesline Project will be on display in Cal Poly 
Pomonas University Park on Oct. 7 from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. This event was scheduled to coincide 
with the Distinguished Lecture Series featuring Judy Shepard, who will discuss violence 
prevention and the legacy of hope her son, Matthew Shepard, leaves behind. The lecture is at 6 
p.m. in the Bronco Student Centers Ursa Major Suite. 
       The Clothesline Project is a powerful testimonial from survivors of assault, rape and 
incest who have created several hundred T-shirts that will be hung in University Park.   
       From 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., local agencies representatives will also be available to provide 
information on violence prevention and services.  
       This event is sponsored by the Cal Poly Pomona Stop Violence Grant Office, the Pride 
Center, the Reentry and Womens Resource Center and Sigma Chi. For more information, call 
(909) 869-3206 and (909) 869-3790. 
        
       Communication Workshop 
       Educator and consultant Lillian Roybal Rose will conduct a workshop on Understanding 
and Being Understood: Building Alliances in a Cross Cultural Environment, Oct. 10-11, 8:30 
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Organized by the ReEntry and WoMens Resource Center, the conference is 
$200, which includes materials, refreshments and lunch. Discounts are available for Cal Poly 
Pomona students, faculty and staff. For more information, call Pat Davis at (909) 869-3206.

            CAL POLY POMONA ANNOUNCES 2003-04 THEATER SEASON: 

  THE CRUCIBLE, THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST AND OUTDOOR FESTIVAL 
 
        Cal Poly Pomonas 2003-04 theater season opens with Arthur Millers Tony award-winning play 

The Crucible, which celebrates its 50th
                                       anniversary this year. The season will continue in February with 

Oscar Wildes The Importance of Being Earnest and an outdoor series of one-act plays in May. 

        Miller has experienced lasting success with The Crucible, his timeless play about the infamous 

1692 Salem witch trials. It is a cautionary tale written during the McCarthy era, which were filled with 

similar fears involving Communism and blacklists.  

        It seemed very apropos to honor the great American playwright and celebrate such an auspicious 

anniversary of the play, director Linda Bisesti said. The similarities today are strikingly similar to the 

climate of the 1950s: then it was communists, today it is terrorists. We live in a time in which a person 

risks being labeled unpatriotic if they dont agree with the administrations policies. 

        The Crucible will run from Nov. 14-23. 

        On a lighter note, the winter quarter will feature The Importance of Being Earnest by Wilde. 

        The sophisticated satire often passes as a comedy of manners. Seemingly about the foibles and 

complications of romance and its courtship requirements for the upper class during the progressive age of 

science and art (the Victorian Era), Earnest also reveals the hypocrisy of a fashionably educated, sexually 

repressed, materialistic and spiritually devoid group of people who think the world revolves around their 

lives, said director Robert G. Leigh.

        The Importance of Being Earnest will run Feb. 20-29. 

                In spring, the Found Space Festivalan outdoor series of one-act playswill include Mud                                                                                                

directed by professor Leslie Ann Rivers, Speak Spanish for Me written by professor Bernardo Solano and 

at least two one-acts that will be written in Solanos fall playwriting class. 

        Mud, written by Maria Irene Fornes, follows an emotionally and financially destitute womans 

tragic search for love and a socially stimulating life. Speak Spanish for Me is set at Yale, Solanos alma 

mater. The main character, Jose Escobar, is a new student looking to find his place behind the ivy-covered 

walls. The two student plays will be set at Cal Poly Pomona.  The audience will watch each play at the 

actual location. 

                The Found Space Festival will run May 13-23. 

 
        Ticket prices for The Crucible and The Importance of Being Earnest will be $14 for general 

admission and $8 for students, seniors and Cal Poly Pomona faculty and staff with identification.  Tickets 

purchased in advance will receive $2 off.  For show times and additional information, call the Box Office

       BIOTREK WEB SITE ENDOWMENT ENSURES WORLDWIDE ACCESS  

                TO CAL POLY POMONAS GARDENS AND RESEARCH  

 
       Soon, schoolchildren can visit a rainforest and report on its plant and wildlife from the 

comfort of home, thanks to a recent gift Cal Poly Pomona has received that allows anyone access 

to the universitys rainforest with the click of a mouse. 

       The universitys College of Science has received a generous $270,000 gift from the 

Ernest Prete Jr. Foundation that will open the BioTrek educational experience to the world  or 

more precisely, the World Wide Web. 

        Now students anywhere in the world will have a chance to share in the experience of 

visiting a rainforest without having to actually be in one or even be here on campus, says 

Richard Pumerantz, director of development for the College of Science. Its all here on our Web 

site, without the need for any special software.  

       BioTrek and its three Rain Bird Learning Centers provide hands-on and electronic 

learning experiences of the worlds tropical rainforests, native gardens and aquatic environments 

of California and the tropics. The on-campus project, which opened in October 2002, is managed 

by the universitys Biological Sciences department, and received major funding from the Rain 

Bird Corp., a leading manufacturer of irrigation equipment. 

       The Ernest Prete Jr. Foundation has endowed in perpetuity the BioTrek Web site 

(www.csupomona.edu/~biotrek). This is the first time a Web site has been endowed within the 

23-campus California State University system, and coordinators believe it may also be the first in 

the history of the Internet.

       The endowment also provides for the creation of the Ernest Prete Jr. Global Access 
Project, which will allow online visitors an opportunity to use video cameras, telemetry and 
Internet resources to explore BioTreks indoor rainforest, ethnobotany gardens and aquatic 
research laboratories. Through live webcams, visitors will be able to scan the rainforest to view 
various plants in their environment or watch a Spectacled Caiman feed on small fish and mice. 
From the universitys site, they may link to other rainforests in Venezuela or Malaysia. In the 
near future, short video clips will be incorporated that will allow visitors to learn, for example, 
about the California Poppy, through a virtual classroom experience with Cal Poly Pomona 
faculty. 
        BioTrek struck me as being a great cause and a great project, said Mohammad Virani, 
president of the Ernest Prete Jr. Foundation. Its a really proactive approach to the environment 
rather than reactive. Its great that well be able to provide help in creating awareness of 
rainforests and their effects on the planet.

         NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AWARDS $160,000 GRANT TO  

    CAL POLY POMONA FOR A NEW PARALLEL COMPUTING LABORATORY 

        
       The National Science Foundation has awarded Cal Poly Pomona College of Science 

faculty members a two-year, $160,000 grant that will pay for a computer workstation network 

designed to drive research in parallel and distributed computing. 

       While each successive generation of computers push speed and increase raw processing 

power, there are still limits on what one computer can do when it comes to sorting through 

mountains of raw data. Parallel computing takes a teamwork approach to such undertakings by 

dividing one project into several tasks among a network of computers. 

       Ten people digging a hole is much faster than one person doing it sequentially, said 

Amar Raheja, an assistant professor in computer science and a co-investigator on the project. 

       Working as a team with individual tasks, a network of computers significantly speed up 

the time it takes to complete a project. By the end of this academic year, Cal Poly Pomona will 

have a state-of-the-art parallel computing lab thanks to the NSF grant. 

       Any computation-intensive application could potentially benefit from parallel 

computing, said Hairong Kuang, an assistant professor of computer science and the principal 

investigator on the grant. Sorting data is just one type of application. 

       While a graduate student at UC Irvine, Dr. Kuang used parallel computing to help 

molecular biologists cut the time needed for a mammoth protein identity project from 30 days 

down to three days. 

       They don't need to learn how to write parallel programs, but with the tool I developed, 

they get the speedup, Dr. Kuang said.

Cal Poly PomonaNSF Grant Goes Toward Technology

       In the new lab, Dr. Kuang plans to continue her work, which reshapes existing computer 
programs to take advantage of the parallel computing model. She also plans to introduce students 
to the concept in the forthcoming lab and make it available for senior projects. She hopes the 
prospect of getting to know this type of computing  will attract students to her lab. 
       Dr. Raheja plans to use the computers to work on quickening medical imaging 
technology from minutes to close to real time.  
       The new computer workstations will also have practical implications when installed. 
       Dennis Livesay, an assistant professor of chemistry and one of the grants co-
investigators, plans to use the new lab to analyze the proteins encoded within multiple microbial 
genomes. 
       Solving a proteins structure and subsequently which regions are responsible for its 
function (catalysis) has traditionally been a long and labor-intensive process. Livesays work 
attempts to reduce that time investment by skipping structure and predict functions from the 
sequence of amino acids that make a particular protein. 
       Functional regions are predicted from locally conserved strings of amino acids. In the 
hands of a biochemist, knowing the functional regions can help design further experiments and 
aid the overall understanding of the protein. 
       Recent genomic sequencing efforts, like the Human Genome Project, have created a 
biological data avalanche, Dr. Livesay said. This glut of data is generating nearly as many 
problems as it provides answers. Work like ours attempts to create efficient and accurate 
computational tools for managing and understanding this huge amount of data.  And then, only 
after these tools have been developed, will the promised biomedical advances begin to appear. 
       The parallel computing lab includes an Mbps network with eight Sun workstations. The 
grant will pay for a Gbps Myrinet and 8 PCs in the 2004/05 academic year. NSF announced the 
award of the grant in August. 
              Cal Poly Pomona faculty members who will benefit from the grant include: Hairong 
Kuang, Amar Raheja, Gilbert Young, Keyu Jiang and Sang-Eon Park from the computer science 
department and Dennis Livesay from the chemistry department.

         CAL POLY POMONA MUSIC FACULTY PRESENTS FUND-RAISING  
                 FACULTY JAMBOREE TITLED A DAY IN THE LIFE  
                                                   
       The music department at Cal Poly Pomona will showcase its eighth annual Faculty 
Jamboree on Friday, Oct. 24, at 8 p.m. in the Music Recital Hall. 
       This years show, A Day in the Life, will take a comical and musical look at a typical 
day in the Music department. 
       About eight years ago, the faculty decided they wanted to do something that would take 
them out of their normal routine and allow them to perform onstage together, says Teresa Kelly, 
music department publicist. The Faculty Jamboree is meant to highlight our faculty in a 
different light than theyre usually seen. 
       Nearly a dozen faculty and staff members will perform at this years event. 
       Highlights of the upcoming jamboree include a vocal piece, Freeway, performed by Iris 
Levine, Janine Riveire, Phillip Clarke and Dave Grasmick, and composed by Stan Gibb; a song 
performance of Whats the Matter With Kids Today by Kim Guenette; a voice class taught by 
Susan Burns; and an audience sing-along conducted by Riveire. In addition, Peter Yates will 
perform on guitar, and Dave Cahueque, Dave Kopplin and Dave Tough  better known as The 
Radio Daves  will give their rendition of several Beattles tunes. 
       Tickets are $7, and proceeds go toward scholarships and other departmental needs. For 
more information, contact Teresa Kelly at (909) 869-3554 or reserve seats online at

       Five contemporary artists from mainland China will display their work at the W. Keith 

and Janet Kellogg University Art Gallery from Nov. 4 to Dec. 12. A reception for the artists, 

which is free and open to the public, will be Nov. 6 from 5-8 p.m. 

       Wang Yigang, Wu Wei, Zhao Lixian, Liu Jian and Wang Guangyi will be part of the 

exhibit, Pop Vision, which crosses three types of Chinese art trends: political pop, cynical 

realism and new realism. 

       The artists use their crafts as outlets for their statements on political and popular culture.  

The works reflect subjects like the family unit, the voiceless, political propaganda and the 

representation of women. 

       Gallery hours are Tuesday through Friday, from 11 a.m.-4 p.m., and Saturday, from

                        BAT EXPERT FROM CAL POLY POMONA  
                 AVAILABLE TO DISTINGUISH FACT FROM FICTION 
 
       STORY:   They fly at night, are sometimes found in abandoned buildings and are often 
                   used on Halloween as symbols of fright. However, bats are largely 
                   undeserving of the bad wrap theyve endured, says Dr. Donald Straney, 
                   dean of the College of Science at Cal Poly Pomona and bat evolution expert. 

                   Only three species of bats are vampires, living off the blood of livestock, 
                   but the other 900 or so species avoid the red stuff, he says.  

                   Bats, in general, are beneficial, says Straney. They help control insects 
                   and pests like crickets and mosquitoes. Bats may seem scary, but about the 
                   only scary thing about them is what they do to fruit trees.  

         WHO:   Dr. Donald Straney, dean of the College of Science at Cal Poly Pomona. As 
                   a professor and scientist, Straneys research has led him to an extended 
                   study on understanding patterns of diversification in bats, including the use 
                   of embryological investigations of skeletal development. His current 
                   research on morphological change in ant evolution is ongoing. Straney 
                   received his bachelor of science and master of science degrees from 
                   Michigan State Univeristy and his Ph.D. in zoology from UC Berkeley.

                    WILDFIRE EXPERT FROM CAL POLY POMONA  
           AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE INSIGHT ON FIRES AND ECOLOGY 
 
       STORY:   Dr. Ronald Quinn of Cal Poly Pomona has focused much of his research on 
                   the dynamics of ecological processes after fire and can provide insight on 
                   how fires work and how forests recover. Aside from studying fires, Quinns 
                   work nearly came to his doorstep recently when the Grand Prix fire forced 
                   an evacuation of his Claremont neighborhood. His home was spared.   

                   In the Western United States, vegetation evolves with fire, he says. 
                   However, the lack of small, low-intensity fires over the past century has 
                   created dense forests packed with potential fuel. That along with other 
                   variables, such as the bark beetle and years of drought, has resulted in 
                   crown fires, which dont just burn the ground vegetation, but climb to 
                   treetops and often rage out of control.  

         WHO:   Currently faculty director of the John T. Lyle Center for Regenerative 
                   Studies, Quinn joined Cal Poly Pomonas faculty as a member of the 
                   department of biological sciences in 1969. Since then his teaching has 
                   included a wide variety of undergraduate and graduate courses including 
                   ecology, environmental sciences, interdisciplinary general education, and 
                   regenerative studies. 
                    
                   A cooperating scientist with the U.S. Forest Service, he has collaborated 
                   with fire ecologists on four continents and spent a sabbatical as a Senior 
                   Fulbright Scientist working in the mountains of Spain. Quinn spends a part 
                   of each summer studying fire ecology of aspen trees in the mountains of 
                   Arizona, and is compiling a book on the natural history of California 
                   chaparral.

            CAL POLY POMONA THEATER TO STAGE THE CRUCIBLE, 

    WITH PROCEEDS FROM NOV. 15 SHOW TO BENEFIT WILDFIRE VICTIMS 
 
        From Nov. 14-23, Cal Poly Pomonas Theater department will stage Arthur Millers Tony award-
winning play The Crucible, which celebrates its 50th
                                                    anniversary this year. In addition, proceeds from the 
Saturday, Nov. 15, show will be donated to the American Red Cross to benefit victims of the recent 
wildfires. 

        Miller has experienced lasting success with The Crucible, his timeless play about the infamous 
1692 Salem witch trials. It is a cautionary tale written during the McCarthy era, which was filled with 
similar fears involving communism and blacklists.  

        It seemed very apropos to honor the great American playwright and celebrate such an auspicious 
anniversary of the play, director Linda Bisesti said. The similarities today are strikingly similar to the 
climate of the 1950s: then it was communists, today it is terrorists. We live in a time in which a person 
risks being labeled unpatriotic if they dont agree with the administrations policies. 

        The Crucible will be performed at 8 p.m. on Nov. 14-15 and Nov. 20-22 and close with a 2 p.m. 
matinee on Nov. 23. The opening night performance on Nov. 14 includes a reception with cast and crew 
after the show. The Nov. 20 show will be followed by a panel discussion on Witch Hunts and Modern-
day McCarthyism. 

        Ticket prices for The Crucible are $14 for general admission and $8 for students and seniors.  
Tickets purchased in advance will receive $2 off.  For additional information, call the Box Office Hotline 
at (909) 869-3800. 

        Cal Poly Pomona is located at 3801 W. Temple Ave. in Pomona. Parking permits are 
required, and can be purchased for $4 at the Visitor Information Booth along Kellogg Drive.

                  CAL POLY POMONA CIS DEPARTMENT RECEIVES  

             2003 AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE IN STRATEGIC PLANNING 
 
       The Association for Strategic Planning awarded Cal Poly Pomonas Computer 

Information Systems department the 2003 Excellence in Strategic Planning Award in the Not-

for-Profit Organization category.  

       The award was presented to department chair Steven Curl at the associations third 

annual conference, Strategy in Action, on Oct. 14 in Los Angeles. 

       Curl and two professors were part of the Development Plan Committee, which led faculty 

on a retreat where they discussed ways to create a strategic plan suitable for the department. The 

inspiration for the new plan came from the need to stretch current resources to accommodate the 

departments growing needs. 

       The department focused on online teaching, reorganizing specialization tracks with the 

departments curricula, giving more priority to graduate education and expanding outreach to 

high school, community college and reentry students. 

       The Association for Strategic Planning is a California-based not-for-profit professional 

association focused on strategic planning and strategic management.  They initiated the award 

program to encourage excellence and innovation in strategic planning.   

       Entries were judged on Mission/Vision/Advantage, External Assessment, Internal 

Assessment, Plans and Objectives, Innovation and Top-Management Participation.

         CAL POLY POMONA URGES FALL 2004 FRESHMAN APPLICANTS  
                 TO MEET NOV. 30 DEADLINE, USE ONLINE PROCESS 
        
       Students who plan to apply for admission to Cal Poly Pomona in fall quarter 2004 are 
strongly encouraged to submit their applications before the Nov. 30 deadline, preferably through 
the CSU Mentor web site at http://www.csumentor.com.  
       We expect the demand for access to Cal Poly Pomona to reach an all time high, said 
university President J. Michael Ortiz. For students to receive full consideration for admission, it 
is essential that we receive their applications no later than Nov. 30. 
       Despite anticipating higher demands for admission, the state Legislature notified the 
California State University that its 23 campuses should not expect any additional funding for 
enrollment growth next fall. In an effort to maintain educational quality for current and 
prospective students, supplemental criteria using an eligibility index (using the SAT I or ACT 
score and high school grade point average) will be applied to first-time freshman applicants from 
non-local schools.  
       Cal Poly Pomona will continue to admit all fully CSU eligible first-time freshman 
applicants who graduate from high schools in Cal Poly Pomonas local service area on the basis 
of CSU admission eligibility criteria. All other first-time freshman applicants will be rank-
ordered by eligibility index. The academic characteristics of the freshman applicant pool will 
determine the eligibility index cut-off and may vary from year to year. 
       For more information about freshman impaction at Cal Poly Pomona, including a list of 
the universitys local service area high schools, visit http://www.csupomona.edu/~admissions/ or 
call (909) 869-3210.

   TWILL BE TWO NIGHTS BEFORE CHRISTMAS WHEN THE CAL POLY UNIVERSITIES   
     2004 ROSE FLOAT MAKES ITS LENGTHY TRIP TO PASADENA DECORATION TENT                             
 
         What:   Bobs Barnacle Band, the 56th consecutive Cal Poly Universities entry into the 
                  Rose Parade, will make a late night excursion from the Cal Poly Pomona campus 
                  to the Brookside Tent decoration center located just south of the Rose Bowl in 
                  Pasadena. The Cal Poly Universities project  involving both the Pomona and 
                  San Luis Obispo campuses  is the only Rose Parade float entry designed, 
                  constructed, decorated and financed entirely by students. 
          Who:   Students in the Cal Poly Universities Rose Float Committees 
         When:   From 10:30 p.m. on Dec. 23 until roughly 2:30 a.m. on Dec. 24  
        Where:   Begins at the Cal Poly Pomona Rose Float Lab (Building 64) and ends at the 
                  Rose Bowl Parking Lots Brookside Tent decoration center 
          Why:  From Dec. 23-31, final float preparations, decorating and judging takes place at 
                  the Brookside Tent. Because of the floats size (30 ft tall, 18 ft wide, and 55 ft in 
                  length) and obvious potential for traffic distraction, it is transported at night. 
  Opportunity:  This is a unique photo opportunity, offering a glimpse at a significant stage in 
                  preparing the Cal Poly Universities Rose Float that the public might not normally 
                  see. University President J. Michael Ortiz will also take part in the trip. Reporters 
                  and photographers are welcome to observe the floats journey and the logistical 
                  work involved in such a move. Driving directions are included with this release.

                  QUICK FACTS ON THE CAL POLY UNIVERSITIES  

   2004 TOURNAMENT OF ROSES PARADE ENTRY BOBS BARNACLE BAND 
 
       Q: Who can visit and/or work on the float? 

       About two dozen students from Cal Poly Pomona and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo work on 

the Rose float year round. The two campuses, located approximately 225 miles apart, manage to 

coordinate a year-round effort to complete the float for each years parade. Throughout the 12-

month period, both student committees work closely together on the design and construction of 

their respective portion to ensure the float is built to specification.  

       Between Christmas and New Year another 1,000 volunteer decorators from the 

universities as well as the surrounding communities come together to decorate the Cal Poly 

Universities float in Pasadena every year. The two universities encourage anyone who is 

interested to join in the fun of decorating the Cal Poly float.   

       All media members are invited to visit the Cal Poly Universities float construction site at 

any time. During construction at the Pomona float lab, it is suggested journalists contact Janetta 

McDowell at (909) 869-3642 for directions and confirmation of work hours.  

       Once the float is moved to the Brookside Tent on Dec. 23, journalists may visit during 

construction hours. Call the Cal Poly Universities Operations Center at the Brookside Tent at 

(626) 666-1489.  

        
       Q: How do the universities develop their float entry? 

       Every year the student Rose Float Committees of Cal Poly Pomona and San Luis Obispo 

organize a concept contest. Entries are submitted from students, staff, alumni, family, friends and

the local communities from each campus. A joint student committee selects the actual theme 
from more than 100 concepts that are submitted.  
        
       Q: What is the theme of Cal Poly Universities 2004 float entry? 
       The theme of this years Tournament of Roses Parade is Music, Music, Music. Cal 
Poly Universities float project, Bobs Barnacle Band, depicts a sea creature band, led by its 
skeleton conductor, playing on a sunken pirate ship. Once a mighty vessel, the pirate ship is now 
broken in two and provides the perfect stage for a band of eccentric creatures and their 
instruments. As the starfish singer makes its entrance crooning from a large clamshell, the band's 
audience of fish and crustaceans frolic and dance among treasure chests, barrels, coral and 
seaweed. While the skeleton lookout watches from the crows nest and the helmsman steers the 
ship along the sea floor, "Bob's Barnacle Band" continues to make music somewhere beyond the 
sea. 
        
       Q:  How would you describe the floats construction? 
       Bobs Barnacle Band will be a special over-height float at 30 feet tall, 18 feet wide, and 
55 feet in length. The two Cal Poly Universities manage to coordinate a year-round effort to 
complete the float for each years parade. Throughout the 12-month period, both student 
committees work closely together on the design and construction of their respective portion to 
ensure the float is built to specification. Usually during the Thanksgiving break from classes, the 
San Luis Obispo portion of the float is transported to the Pomona campus where the two frames 
are united. This is where the float will receive its final construction phase. Around the third week 
of December, the float is transported under tow more than 30 miles from the Pomona campus 
over streets and byways to its assigned decorating site in Pasadena. 
        
       Q: How will the float be decorated? 
       In all, students working on the float estimate that more than 17,000 roses, 550 bunches of 
mums and 300 bunches of carnations will be used to decorate the Cal Poly Universities 2004 
float Bobs Barnacle Band. Mallaluca and redwood bark will be used on the ship deck and hull

to create a natural weathered wood finish, incorporated with the use of dry materials, such as 
ground flax, and light and dark lettuce seed.  The various sea creatures will be decorated with a 
combination of either dry material or fresh flowers. For instance, the octopus will be covered in a 
variety of red, bronze, golden yellow and white mums. Roses will be used to accent the borders 
of the ship and deck railings. Moss and fresh flowers in arrangements will be incorporated both 
on the ship and float decking to create a sea foam and spray effect. Carnation petals will be used 
to create the soft pink of the inner clamshell as well as create smaller fresh arrangements to form 
sea coral. The husk of bird of paradise seeds, lilies, liatris, gerber daisies, gladiolas, iris, 
solidago, asters, freesia, sea peas, babys breath and other flowers will also be included.  
                
       Q: What animation will be incorporated? 
       The center mast of the pirate ship will be 30 feet high and hydraulically powered. The 
octopus will have all eight of its arms moving to play the coral piano and the drums surrounding 
him. The clamshell in the front of the ship will open to reveal the starfish singer, while the rudder 
of the ship will move back and forth in the sand where the ship is embedded.  The sea creatures 
in the band as well as their instruments will also be moving in rhythm to the music. The skeleton 
crew on the ship will also be animated. The helmsman steering the ship will move its arms from 
side to side to turn the wheel. The conductor in front of the ship will wave its arms to lead the 
band, fall apart, and reconstruct itself through electronic animation. Gun ports on the ship will 
open to reveal cannons that move out to shoot bubbles.

LONG-STANDING ROSE PARADE FLOAT TRADITION AT CAL POLY UNIVERSITIES 
        CELEBRATES HANDS-ON LEARNING, IMAGINATION AND INGENUITY  
                                                     
        Every Jan. 1, those from Cal Poly Pomona and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo celebrate the New Year 
as well as observe a long-standing tradition in the Tournament of Roses Parade. Students from the two 
universities have designed, constructed, decorated and financed entries to the Tournament of Roses 
Parade every year since 1949. Involvement in this project highlights the Cal Poly Universities learn-by-
doing philosophy as students spend nearly a year developing these decorative floats from design 
conception to welding together steel and pasting petals to driving the contraption down Colorado 
Boulevard.  
         What is now a 56-year tradition actually came about much by accident. Don Miller, a student 
who was then attending the California Sate Polytechnic Schools Voorhis campus (a forerunner to Cal 
Poly Pomona) and majoring in ornamental horticultural, had always wanted to get involved in the Rose 
Parade. Millers father was in fact a former Tournament of Roses president. 
        In September 1948, Miller received a call from Rose Parade officials, asking if Cal Poly could 
have a float ready for the Jan. 1, 1949 parade to replace an entry that had just dropped out. Miller, without 
checking with any campus administrator or faculty member, committed the university to an entry. 
        At that time, the Voorhis campus was an all-male enrollment devoted to agricultural studies. As 
word of the challenge spread, the Voorhis student body pulled together to meet the deadline.  
        The first float earned the parades Award of Merit. Since then, the annual Rose Float project 
has garnered another 43 awards as well as grown in size and scope, involving both campus communities 
in Pomona and San Luis Obispo.  
        Other landmark years include the universities first use of hydraulics for animation in 1968, the 
first use of computer-controlled animation in 1978, and the first use of fiber optics in the 1982 entry.

        CAL POLY POMONAS ZUOYUE WANG, A CLAREMONT RESIDENT, 

             WINS PRIZE FOR EXCELLENCE IN A RESEARCH ARTICLE 
 
       Assistant Professor of history Zuoyue Wang, Claremont resident, won the prestigious 

Derek Price/Rod Webster Prize for 2003 from the History of Science Society. Wang shared the 

award with Peter Neushul of the University of California, Santa Barbara, for their co-authored 

article, Between the Devil and Deep Sea: C. K. Tseng, Mariculture, and the Politics of Science 

in Modern China, which was published in the March 2000 issue of the societys journal Isis: An 

International Review Devoted to the History of Science and Its Cultural Influences.  

       The Derek Price/Rod Webster Prize is given in recognition of excellence in a research 

article published in Isis, the respected international journal dedicated to the history of science. 

Eligible articles are those published in issues of Isis three years prior to the year in which the 

award is given. Wangs paper studied the experiences of C. K. Tseng, a United States-trained 

Chinese marine biologist who pioneered mariculture, agriculture of the sea, and who almost 

single-handedly launched the vast Chinese seaweed industry against a turbulent political 

background in the 20th century.  

       The award committee praised the article for achieving [a] combination of narrative 

drama, historical importance, and historiographic sophistication and for its prose that goes 

beyond clarity to achieve elegance and eloquence. 

       Wang is the first CSU faculty member to win this prize in its 24-year history. He is 

donating his award of $500 to Cal Poly Pomona. He joined the university in 1999, and teaches 

courses in the history of science and technology and American history.

       CAL POLY POMONA NAMES MICHAEL GUERIN AS CHIEF OF POLICE 
          
        Michael Guerin, who is currently serving as the chief of the Law Enforcement Branch of the 
Governors Office of Emergency Services, has been named the new Chief of Police for Cal Poly Pomona.  
His appointment is effective Jan. 5, 2004. 
        Mike Guerin is a great addition to the university family, said Cal Poly Pomona President J. 
Michael Ortiz. His diverse background in law enforcement makes him an ideal choice for this important 
position on campus. 
        Guerin joins the university after nearly 30 years in law enforcement. At the Governors Office of 
Emergency Services, he administrated a staff of peace officers providing assistance and coordination to 
state and local law enforcement agencies in preparing for, and responding to, emergency situations.  In 
this role, he is the state law enforcement mutual aid coordinator and the executive officer for the State 
Strategic Committee on Terrorism and the chair of the State Threat Advisory Committee. 
        Other experiences include work as chief investigator for the Department of Motor Vehicles, 
deputy director of the Governors Office of Emergency Services and in municipal police agencies in 
Pasadena, La Verne and Cypress. 
        He is an adjunct instructor at the California Specialized Training Institute and the federal 
governments National Emergency Training Center.  Guerin has been published in the FBI Law 
Enforcement Bulletin, the Journal of California Law Enforcement, the Tactical Edge, Western Fire 
Journal and the British Columbia Police Journal. 
        The position of chief of police on a college campus must possess extraordinary interpersonal and 
communication skills, said interim vice president for Student Affairs Gary Fredericksen. Chief Guerin 
is an excellent fit for Cal Poly Pomona.  It is also important to acknowledge the extraordinary job of Chief 
Jerry Lipson over the past nine months.   
        Guerin has a bachelors degree in criminal justice administration from San Diego State University 
and an associates degree in Police Science from Chaffey College.  He is a graduate of Upland High 
School.

                CAL POLY POMONA RECEIVES $100,000 GRANT FROM  

     S. MARK TAPER FOUNDATION TO SUPPORT RENAISSANCE SCHOLARS

 
       Former foster youth participating in Cal Poly Pomonas Renaissance Scholars program 

are now eligible for a special scholarship thanks to a $100,000 grant awarded by the S. Mark 

Taper Foundation through Bienvenidos Childrens Center, a non-profit agency serving abused 

and neglected children and at-risk families throughout LA County.  One of its four programs, 

Bienvenidos Foster Family Agency, will partner with the program.  This two-year grant will 

provide up to 10 scholarships annually to Renaissance Scholars who are making satisfactory 

progress toward their degrees. 

       The S. Mark Taper Foundation grant will truly make a difference in the lives of these 

talented and motivated students, said Associate Vice President for Student Services Jim 

Norfleet, founding director of the program.  These young men and women have overcome 

incredible odds to pursue higher education.  This grant will recognize their accomplishments and 

help them achieve a dream many thought impossible. 

        Each year, more than 20,000 youth age out of the foster care system and are expected 

to make the transition to adulthood independently. Cal Poly Pomona established the Renaissance 

Scholars program in January 2002 to assist foster youth in making this transition successfully.  In

addition to receiving financial aid and scholarships, Renaissance Scholars are eligible for on-

campus housing, employment opportunities, academic advising, tutoring, mentoring, health care, 

and other services to help them complete their education and make a positive difference in the 

world. 

              One of the major benefits that I have received from being a Renaissance Scholar is that I 

can achieve anything I set my mind to, and there are people who care about my success, 

comments Sara Pernillo, a Liberal Studies major and scholarship recipient from La Puente. This 

grant from the S. Mark Taper Foundation will provide financial support that will allow me to 

focus more on my primary job of being a successful student.

       Dr. William B. Harvey, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based American Council

Harveys message will offer practical strategies to assist the campus community in reaffirming 

personal and institutional commitments to diversity and equal opportunity. 

       Harvey received his doctorate of education in anthropology and masters in education

and leaders in the area of diversity both on and off campus, will be presented to Diamond Bar 

resident Ingrid C. Johnson, a community leader and co-founder of the Council of African

             CAL POLY UNIVERSITIES SEEK CREATIVE DESIGN IDEAS  

                 FOR 2005 TOURNAMENT OF ROSES PARADE FLOAT 

 
       The Cal Poly Universities in Pomona and San Luis Obispo invite the community to 

participate in a concept design contest for their next Tournament of Roses Parade entry. Anyone 

may submit a design concept based on next years general parade theme, Celebrate Family. 

The contest winner receives two tickets to the Rose Bowl or $250. Entries are due Friday, Feb. 6, 

at noon. 

       Entries should portray an idea for a float rather than a finished design. Submissions may 

be black & white sketches, color drawings or even a written description. Make sure the 

contestants name, address and phone number are placed in a sealed envelope attached to the 

back of the entry. Drawings submitted with the name visible may be disqualified. There are no 

size restrictions for entries, but contestants are advised that drawings approximately 11 x 17 or 

larger tend to present ideas more clearly than smaller ones. Actual float sizes are about 55 x 18 

x 174, but can be extended for special designs. 

       All entries will be judged by the merit of the idea rather than the quality of the drawing or 

description. There is no limit to how many times a person may enter.  

       Entries may be mailed to: Cal Poly Pomona, Rose Float Committee, Building 26, Room 

131, Float Concept Contest, 3801 W. Temple Ave., Pomona, CA 91768. Entries may also be 

hand delivered to Janetta McDowell in the Office of Student Life, Building 26, Room 121; or 

Ron Simons, University Advancement, Building 98, fifth floor.

     CAL POLY POMONAS CLIFF STOVER, A SAN BERNARDINO RESIDENT,  

          TO BE FEATURED ON CABLE SHOW JUNKYARD MEGA-WARS 
 
       In the engineering labs at Cal Poly Pomona, faculty associate/projects lab director Cliff 

Stover is intimately familiar with the theory and principles behind mechanics. He recently put 

that knowledge to the test in the cable television show Junkyard Mega-Wars.  

       On Junkyard Mega-Wars, two eclectic teams of builders and artisans are given only 10 

hours to create large, complex machines from nothing but junkyard refuse. In Stovers episode, 

which premiers Feb. 3 at 10 p.m. on TLC (The Learning Channel), the teams built drag boats 

that race through a 200-yard straightaway. Stover worked on the engine and drive train of the 

contraption.  

       It was a fun learning experience, said Stover, who took part in the competition this 

summer in triple-digit heat. Youre thrown into a junkyard with people you dont know, then 

suddenly they turn you loose and youve got just 10 hours to build something out of nothing.  

       To find out how Stovers teams drag boat performs, watch TLC on Feb. 3 at 10 p.m. or 

Feb. 8 at 3 p.m. Look for the Cal Poly Pomona patches Stover wears on the show, courtesy of the 

Bronco Bookstore.

        $300K STATE DEPARTMENT GRANT ALLOWS CAL POLY POMONA  
       TO ASSIST RUSSIAN UNIVERSITY IN CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT  
         
        The Collins School of Hospitality Management will help a Russian university develop its 
hospitality curriculum thanks to an unprecedented United States Department of State grant in 
hospitality for $299,804.  

        The three-year grant allows groups of instructors from Petrozavodsk State University 
(PetrSU) in Russia to take educational visits to the Collins School in order to develop 14 courses 
in tourism as well as hospitality and restaurant management at their northwestern Russia campus. 
Other objectives include acquiring new library material; improving faculty English language 
skills; establishing Internet-based distance learning and continuing education seminars. 

        From Jan. 9 through March 25, an inaugural group of four Russian professors is 
participating in a program at Cal Poly Pomona that familiarizes them with the university's 
courses, provides tours of local hospitality and tourism businesses, and introduces them to 
hospitality leaders and entrepreneurs. Trips include a visit to the Hollywood Walk of Fame to 
watch a star unveiling, a meeting with Hilton Hotel executives, a tour of the South Hills Country 
Club and cooking classes with a student club. In March, they will also create a Russian-themed 
lunch special for the Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch, a unique academic experience in which 
students manage and operate a fine dining restaurant at the Collins School.  

        The first group of Petrozavodsk educators are: Elvira Pavlova, chair of the tourism 
department; Evguenia Sokolova, chair of the foreign language department; and professors 
Alexandre Konovalov and Yelena Pavlova. Leading their 10-week program is Cal Poly Pomona

       The tourism and hospitality business is being developed rapidly in Russia, says Elvira 
Pavlova. We opened a new major in our university a year and a half ago trying to meet the 
needs of community, where we teach future specialists in hospitality and tourism business. What 
we really like about the Collins School is their 'hands-on' philosophy in pedagogy. 

       The partnership between Cal Poly Pomona and Petrozavodsk University was made 
possible through the State Department's Freedom Support Educational Partnership Program, 
created in 1982 to encourage cooperation between academic institutions worldwide.  

       Through the U.S. Department of State, the university has also worked with the State 
Engineering University of Armenia to develop continuing education and educational 
administration and New Bulgarian University in Bulgaria to develop public administration and 
public policy programs.

           THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST TO BE PERFORMED  

            BY CAL POLY POMONA THEATRE DEPARTMENT FEB. 20-29 
 

       Cal Poly Pomonas theatre department will stage Oscar Wildes play The Importance of 

Being Earnest from Feb. 20-29 in the University Theatre. The production is directed by 

professor Robert G. Leigh. 

       In the farcical comedy, two friends assuming the identity Earnest learn the names true 

meaning as they court women in Victorian society.  

       The play is a sophisticated satire that often passes as a comedy of manners, says Leigh. 

Seemingly about the foibles and complications of romance and its courtship requirements for 

the upper class during the Victorian Era, Earnest also reveals the hypocrisy of a fashionably 

educated, sexually repressed, materialistic and spiritually devoid group of people who think the 

world revolves around their lives. 

       Performances will be Feb. 20-21 at 8 p.m.; Feb. 26-28 at 8 p.m.; and Feb. 29 at 2 p.m. 

       Tickets prices are $14 for general admission and $8 for students and seniors. 

Some performances may qualify for a $2 advance-purchase discount. For tickets or more 

information, call the Box Office Hotline at  (909) 869-3800. 

       Cal Poly Pomona is located at 3801 W. Temple Ave. in Pomona. Parking permits are 

required, and can be purchased for $4 at the Visitor Information Booth along Kellogg Drive.

              CAL POLY POMONA SPONSORED ART COLLABORATION  

          ENVISIONING THE FUTURE RAISES COMMUNITY AWARENESS 

 
        Envisioning the Future, the unique collaborative art project sponsored by Cal Poly 
Pomona, will hold its second opening Saturday, Feb. 14, with a series of exhibitions and 
performances to be held at four sites: the Pomona Arts Colony, the Millard Sheets Gallery at 
Fairplex, Nichols Gallery in Pitzer College and the Latino Art Museum in Claremont. All venues 
will be open from 5 to 9 p.m. 

       A project more than two years in the making, Envisioning the Future first opened to the 
public in January. The endeavor involves nine facilitators and eight teams of local artists and art 
students, all working individually or collaboratively under the guidance of artist Judy Chicago 
and photographer Donald Woodman. The teams are working with a range of media including 
painting, sculpture, installation, photography, digital media and the performing arts. 

       The idea was conceived by Barbara Way, dean of the College of Letters, Arts & Social 
Sciences at Cal Poly Pomona, and Cheryl Bookout, a local artist. The pair imagined a project 
that could bring together the art, academic and business communities of the Pomona Valley to 
promote the power and inspiration of art to educate, inspire, and advance change. 

        Exhibitions will continue through Feb. 29.  For more information, call (909) 469-0160 or

       Who says higher education is all work and no play? Cal Poly Pomona and the University 
Educational Trust will host a benefit gala that will feature a special performance by comedy duo 
the Smothers Brothers on Sunday, Feb. 29, at the Pacific Palms Resort in the City of Industry. 
Last year, the event netted $255,000 for student scholarships and academic enhancement. 

       The universitys premier social and support event, Founders Celebration 2004: An 
Evening with the Smothers Brothers will honor the many involved in supporting the universitys 
educational mission and future vision. In addition, it will mark the inaugural year of J. Michael 
Ortiz, the universitys fifth president. 

       Founders Celebration is unique because it is the only all-university fund-raising event, 
said Ron Simons, administrator in charge of University Advancement at Cal Poly Pomona. 
Were proud to present the Smothers Brothers as the nights entertainment as we recognize 
those who help Cal Poly Pomona continue its tradition of excellence. 

       The evening will begin with a hosted reception at 5 p.m., followed by a dinner and a 
voice auction. The Smothers Brothers performance will begin at 7:30 p.m. 

       Marking more than four decades in show business, the Smothers Brothers are considered 
icons of classic American comedy. Tom and Dick Smothers entertain fans with an original blend 
of comedic and musical talents that include stand-up song and banter, dancing and even yo-yo 
tricks.  

       The twosome began as comic folk singers with their first national television appearance 
on The Jack Paar Show in 1961. Since then, they have made guest appearances on television 
programs and talk shows including Jimmy Kimmel Live, Late Show with David Letterman,

American Music Awards and guest-starred on the networks Life With Bonnie series 
starring Bonnie Hunt in October 2003. 

       From 1967-69, the Smothers Brothers hosted their own prime-time variety show on CBS, 
The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. Laced with references to hot topics such as war and 
drugs, The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour became one of the most controversial television 
shows of its time. While they attracted a large audience of hip, politically conscious youth, 
public battles over censorship eventually led to cancellation from the network. Today, the show 
is studied in universities and colleges across the country as an example of some of the political 
and social activism of the 60s.  

       Founders Celebration is Cal Poly Pomonas annual event to raise funds for student 
scholarships and academic enhancement. Tickets including both the dinner and the performance 
are available for $375 per person, with tables priced from $3,500 to $25,000. For more

     LOS ANGELES RESIDENT WINS AWARD FOR OUTSTANDING NEW PLAY  

                     FROM SAN DIEGO THEATRE CRITICS CIRCLE 
 

       The San Diego Theatre Critics Circle recently awarded Cal Poly Pomonas Bernardo 

Solano, assistant professor of theatre, with its Outstanding New Play award. Solano was 

honored for writing Nuevo California, which was performed at the San Diego Repertory 

Theatre last February.  

       The Rep commissioned Solano to write Nuevo California, which is set in 2028, when 

an international group works to build a borderless California following a devastating earthquake.  

       We began by interviewing people in San Diego and Tijuana from all walks of life, 

Solano said. We had town hall forums, workshops and round table discussions in which we 

asked all kinds of questions about life on the border between our two countries. The contact with 

all these amazing people was really the source of inspiration. They provided the main source of 

information for the play.  

       A Los Angeles resident, Solano dedicated more than 2 years developing the play, and is 

honored to receive the award.  

       I was elated to win the award, he said. It really validated the time and effort not just 

by me, but by everyone involved in the production.  I also feel it honors all the people who

       SCHOLARSHIPS AWARDED TO EMANCIPATED FOSTER YOUTH AND 
  RENAISSANCE SCHOLARS ADVISORY BOARD TO BE INSTALLED ON FEB. 25 
 
       Emancipation may mean freedom, but when youth are released from the foster care 
system once they reach 18, the high costs of suddenly becoming independent could be daunting. 
Through the Renaissance Scholars program at Cal Poly Pomona, emancipated foster youth will 
receive assistance in their efforts toward a university degree and self-sufficiency.  

       Nine Renaissance Scholars will each receive a $4,000 scholarship made possible through 
a $100,000 two-year grant from the S. Mark Taper Foundations Bienvenidos Childrens Center, 
a non-profit agency serving abused and neglected children and at-risk families throughout Los 
Angeles County. The awards will be presented on Wednesday, Feb. 25, at 6 p.m. during the 
Renaissance Scholars Advisory Board Installation and Scholarship Dinner held at Kellogg House 
Pomona. 

       Receiving scholarships are: Makeda Bostic of Pomona; Maria Carmen Gil of West 
Covina; Sze Sue Hsiung of Pomona; Melinda Leekin of Pomona; Enrique Montiel of 
Montebello; Sara Pernillo of La Puente; Amber Stroman of Pomona; Laura Timbrook of 
Pomona; and Mallory Williams of Pomona.  

       The evenings program also includes the installation of a Renaissance Scholars Advisory 
Board. The board is dedicated to supporting and advancing the mission of the program, and 
comprises donors, community leaders, alumni, students and university representatives.  

       Joining the board are: Berisha Black, emancipation ombudsman for Los Angeles County 
Department of Children and Family Services; Toni Cooke, senior associate director of the Jim 
Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative; Sarah Ludwick, president of the Ludwick Family 
Foundation; James M. Norfleet, associate vice president for student services at Cal Poly Pomona; 
David M. Speak, professor of political science at Cal Poly Pomona; Amber Stroman, a 
psychology student at Cal Poly Pomona; and Koji M. Uesugi, acting associate director of 
educational equity services and coordinator of Renaissance Scholars at Cal Poly Pomona.

                K-12 STUDENTS MATCH WITS IN DAYLONG REGIONAL  
     SCIENCE OLYMPIAD TOURNAMENT AT CAL POLY POMONA MARCH 6 

              Close to 1,300 elementary, middle and high school students will converge at Cal Poly 
Pomona on Saturday, March 6, after months of study to compete in the 18         th
                                                                                  annual Los Angeles 
County Science Olympiad.  

        Teams of students representing nearly 90 schools in the county will match wits in 
competitions that cover a wide range of fields in science such as forestry, thermodynamics, 
engineering, aerodynamics and cellular biology. Science Olympiad competitions will take place 
throughout the day, beginning at 8 a.m., with awards ceremonies scheduled at 3 p.m. for 
elementary school students and 5 p.m. for middle and high school students.  

        Cal Poly Pomona is proud to host the Science Olympiad and these exceptional 
students, said University President Michael Ortiz. The university and the Science Olympiad 
share a common appreciation for hands-on learning, which engages students in the process of 
applying textbook knowledge to real world problems. 

        The Science Olympiad tournaments are rigorous academic interscholastic competitions 
that consist of a series of individual and team events which students prepare for during the year. 
The competitions have a similar format to such other competitive academic events as the national 
debating competition, academic decathlon or spelling bee. 

        Competitions include constructing a wheeled vehicle that is calibrated to travel between 5 
and 10 meters; building test rockets made of plastic pop bottles; constructing the lightest bridge 
to carry a maximum standard load; identifying and classifying fossil specimens; and identifying

       The top three teams in the middle and high school divisions will move on to compete in 
the Southern California state competition on May 1, which will also be hosted by Cal Poly 
Pomona. 

              The Science Olympiad is a celebration of science and science education, said Gary 
Widdison, who coordinates the event for the Los Angeles County Office of Education. In all of 
the events, students must use what they know to solve problems. This is a fundamental core of 
good science education: to learn and understand a concept so well that you can apply it in a new 
situation. 

       Helping with the logistics and organization of the massive events will be Cal Poly 
Pomona faculty and staff; students from the universitys colleges of education & integrative 
studies, engineering and science; and volunteers from Boeing and Edison International. 

       The regional and state science Olympiads represent a partnership between education and 
businesses, including Biomedix, Boeing International, CNC Engineering, Edison International, 
Regent Properties and Trade Union International.

        CAL POLY POMONA RECEIVES $861,805 GRANT TO HELP IMPROVE  
      LOW NUMBER OF QUALIFIED MATH/SCIENCE TEACHERS IN REGION 
 
        The California Postsecondary Education Commission awarded Cal Poly Pomona a three-year 
grant totaling $861,805 in federal money that is earmarked for improving the quality of teaching and 
learning in Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties. 

        In response to the severe shortage of qualified math and science teachers in California, and 
especially Los Angeles where half of the state's uncredentialed teachers work, Cal Poly Pomona will 
establish a Mathematics Teaching Center within its Department of Mathematics. This center will 
help recruit new teachers, assist the current teachers completing their certification requirements and 
assist new teachers with induction and continuing professional development. 

        Cal Poly Pomona will partner with the unified school districts of Pomona, Rialto, Rowland 
and Snowline. These districts have many teachers who are not highly qualified under the No Child 
Left Behind Act and student test scores are well below the state averages. Cal Poly Pomona math 
professor Laurie Riggs will oversee the project, which is expected to serve more than 40,000 middle 
and high school students in more than 30 schools.  

        According to Riggs, research has documented that teacher quality, especially in the core 
content areas, is the most important school-based factor in determining student achievement. 
Teachers that are not fully credentialed tend to be clustered in hard to teach schools leaving 
students with the highest need at risk.  

        Well-prepared teachers help produce well-prepared students, and the mathematics 
department is committed to a sustained relationship with our partner districts as we seek to support 
this important cause, Riggs said. 

        The California Postsecondary Education Commission has administered federal funds to 
improve teacher professional development since 1984.

     ART TO BE PAINTED DIRECTLY ON THE WALLS DURING FREEWALL,  
 AN EXHIBIT IN CAL POLY POMONAS KELLOGG UNIVERSITY ART GALLERY 

         
        Ten Los Angeles-based artists are painting their work directly on the wall of the W. Keith 
and Janet Kellogg University Art Gallery now through April 10. A reception for the artists, 
which is free and open to the public, will be on March 11 from 7-9 p.m. 

        Barbara Berk, JonMarc Edwards, Brian Moss, Stas Orlovski, Alexandra Grant, Mara 
Lonner, Aaron Noble, Steve Roden, Jay Stuckey and Kim Schoenstadt are part of the exhibit, 
Freewall, which features temporary paintings, drawings and mixed-media created on the 
gallery walls. 

        Rather than bringing finished paintings and objects to the gallery, artists each selected a 
wall and spent two to three weeks developing their artwork on site. At the end of the exhibition, 
all artwork will be sanded off and the walls will be re-painted. 

        The idea behind Freewall was to have the artists leave the privacy of their studio behind 
as well as the notion of art as an object or commodity, said Jody Zellen, assistant professor of 
art and exhibit curator. 

        Gallery hours are Tuesday through Friday, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Saturday, from 
noon to 4 p.m. For more information, call the W. Keith and Janet Kellogg University Art Gallery 
at (909) 869-4302.

            CAL POLY POMONA RANKS THIRD IN COLLEGE RANKINGS  
                             BY CARNEGIE COMMUNICATIONS 
 
        Cal Poly Pomona is the third highest rated regional university in the West according to 
Project Connect 2003, a survey by the market research firm Carnegie Communications. The 
university was also eighth most popular among students.  
        Project Connect looked into the widely criticized process of college rankings, in 
particular U.S. News & World Reports annual Americas Best Colleges issue, which heavily 
measures academic quality based on education experts. Project Connect differs in its approach by 
focusing on the opinions of the primary consumers of higher education  students.  
        Nearly 4,000 college-bound students from across the nation were surveyed for the report, 
which covers private and public universities. Researchers found that students place weight on 
different variables when assessing quality. For example, in other rankings, the greatest weight is 
placed on an institutions peer assessments. Students believe that the student-to-faculty ratio is 
the most accurate indicator of an institutions quality, with peer assessments second.  
        After shifting the weight of variables of academic quality, Cal Poly Pomona experienced 
the largest jump in rankings in the Western Region and the second largest in the nation. It 
increased 29 places from 32 in U.S. News & World Reports last survey.   
        Cal Poly Pomona shared the third slot with Loyola Marymount University in Los 
Angeles. Cal Poly San Luis Obispo was ranked first with Gonzaga University in Washington at 
second. Neighboring university Azusa Pacific University tied for 16 with nearby University of 
Redlands.  
        Among national universities, Yale, Harvard and Stanford were the top three. 
        The Carnegie Communications college rankings are available online at 
http://www.carnegiecomm.com/.

         CAL POLY POMONA HUMAN NUTRITION & FOOD SCIENCE TEAM  
              CREATES HEALTHY TREATS TO INCREASE DAILY FIBER 
                                                     
        Will a cookie a day keep the doctor away? A Human Nutrition & Food Science team is 
working with one of Americas leading packaged food companies to create a high-fiber cookie 
that will make it easier to increase an individuals daily roughage intake. 

        Most Americans are failing to meet the recommended amounts of total dietary fiber 
(TDF) per day, but almost everyone eats cookies, so we wanted to hide fiber in cookies, says 
Human Nutrition & Food Science (HNFS) professor Doug Lewis, principal investigator of the 
research. 

        The recommended amounts of total dietary fiber (TDF) were recently modified to 25 and 
38 grams per day for women and men, respectively, while amounts for children (ages 4-13) 
range from 25-31 grams per day, according to the National Academy of Sciences Food & 
Nutrition Board. Studies show that the average American eats less than half of the recommended 
amount. 

        It would take an entire box of oatmeal to equal to just 10 grams of soluble fiber, says 
Lewis.  

        A type of carbohydrate that passes through the human digestive system without being 
broken down into nutrients, fiber is found only in plant foods such as whole-grains, vegetables, 
fruits, nuts and beans.  

        Fiber helps to prevent constipation, hemorrhoids and obesity from overeating. In 
addition, proper fiber consumption improves cholesterol levels and can lower the risk of 
developing certain diseases including heart disease, cancer, diabetes, diverticular disease, as well

as gallstones and kidney stones. 

       The universitys high-fiber food research project is a collaboration between the HNFS 
department and ConAgra Foods Inc., a packaged food company headquartered in Omaha, Neb. 
Lewis and his team  comprised of Maria Botero-Omary, co-investigator and assistant 
professor of HNFS, graduate student Diana Frost, and undergraduate students Elyse Petersen and 
S. Susan  are using ConAgras high-fiber barley variety, Sustagrain, to create fiber-enriched 
baking products, including cookies and tortillas, in on-campus research kitchens.  

       Already the team has been successful in creating a cookie with more than three times the 
amount of fiber found in a typical cookie such as a Grandmas Homestyle, which contains only 
one gram of dietary fiber, says Lewis. 

       The cookies were put through an unscientific acceptance test at the universitys annual 
Pumpkin Festival last fall, where they were very widely received, he says. 

       Lewis plans to use the cookies in a clinical feeding study for 18- to 36-year-olds later this 
year, and the team is expected to report on its research in July. 

       Eventually, the group hopes to develop a healthy, convenient and palatable high-fiber 
snack that may be commercially manufactured. The project still has many hurdles to overcome, 
he says, because it is difficult to increase the amount of fiber without compromising the texture 
and taste of the product. 

       With the current methods, we can produce two cookies with fiber content equal to a 
bowl of oatmeal. But its still high in fat and sugar, and because of that, we cannot put a health 
claim on it by the Food & Drug Administration, says Lewis.

     CAL POLY POMONA DOWNTOWN CENTER TO EXHIBIT AFTERFACT 
                     BY LOS ANGELES ARTIST RICHARD GODFREY 
 
        The Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center will present Afterfact, a selection of works by 
Los Angeles artist Richard Godfrey, through May 1. An artists reception will be April 10 from 
69 p.m. in conjunction with the Pomona Arts Colonys Second Saturday event.  

        Afterfact features a selection of paintings Godfrey completed from 1992 to 2002.  The 
pictures explore pictorial space through the primary device of a central rectangle on a larger 
planar surface. The evolving concerns of the artist will be shown by the development of each 
individual series. These paintings work within the parameters of 20     th
                                                                          century modernism, while 
providing a contrast to and affinity for Godfreys other primary work over these same years.  

        Godfrey is also well-known for his installations using light, reflection, water, fire and 
movement, which are continually exploring the ephemeral qualities of the art experience.  These 
paintings, while seeming the antithesis of this installation, also explore the same nature of the 
experience, but from a more concrete approach.  His work is an exploration of the real, whether 
implied or physically present.  

        Richard Godfrey received his bachelors and masters of fine arts from the San Francisco 
Art Institute. He has held shows at the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery, the Laguna Museum 
of Art, Pasadena Armory Center for the Arts, Otis Art Institute and the Kitakyushu Museum in 
Kitakyushu, Japan.  

        The Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center is located at 300 W. Second St. in the Pomona 
Arts Colony. Gallery hours are Tuesday through Saturday, noon to 6 p.m.  For more information 
on the Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center or the Godfrey showing, please contact the Cybele 
Garcia at (909) 469-0080.

         CAL POLY POMONA HELPS GIRL SCOUTS EARN MERIT BADGES,  
        EXPLORE THE FIELD OF ENGINEERING DURING GIRL SCOUT DAY 
 
        Close to 150 junior girl scouts from the Girl ScoutsSpanish Trails Council are expected 
to take part in Girl Scout Day at Cal Poly Pomona on Saturday, April 17, from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
The scouts will go through six workstations while earning their Making It Matter badge and 
learning engineering fundamentals. 

         Engineering is a great career for girls to pursue. An engineer uses her math and science 
skills coupled with creativity and imagination to solve problems, says Barbara Hacker, 
professor of chemical & materials engineering and the campus director of Girl Scout Day. We 
want to help girls realize that engineering is fun and they can do it. 

        Sponsored by the Fluor Corp. in association with the universitys chapter of the Society 
of Women Engineers, Girl Scout Day would not be possible without the volunteer efforts of 
numerous community members, students, faculty and staff.  

        Workstations to be visited during the day include: Computer Aided Design and Take 
Apart; Bridge Building; Making (Electrical) Connections; Making Things Move; Making a 
Polymer; and Engineers in Action.  

        For more than a decade the College of Engineering has hosted a similar program, Merit 
Badge Day, during which Boy Scouts from across Southern California come to campus. Both 
community programs are designed to introduce young people to a potential profession.

     BID TO NATIONALS AT             S CIENCE     O  LYMPIAD AT CAL POLY POMONA  

              Some of the top middle and high school students in Southern California will converge at 
Cal Poly Pomona on Saturday, May 1, to compete for a state title in the SCIENCE OLYMPIAD. 
The top scoring middle and high school teams will move on to represent Southern California at the 
national competition in Huntingdon, Penn. from May 21-22. 

        Teams of students representing nearly 50 schools will match wits in competitions that 
cover a wide range of fields in science such as forestry, mechanical engineering and cellular 
biology. Science Olympiad competitions will take place from 8:45 a.m. to 2:45 p.m., with the 
awards ceremony scheduled at 6 p.m.  

        Defending national champion Troy High School (Orange County) will be among the 24 
participating high schools vying for a bid to the nationals. In the middle school division, El 
Rancho Charter School (Orange County) is back to see if they can improve their impressive third 
place finish at last years nationals  but first they have to face fierce competition from 23 
Southern California schools.  

         Cal Poly Pomona is proud to host the Science Olympiad and these exceptional 
students, said University President Michael Ortiz. The university and the Science Olympiad 
share a common appreciation for hands-on learning, which engages students in the process of 
applying textbook knowledge to real world problems.

Cal Poly Pomona  State Science Olympiad 
Page 2 of 3 

       The Science Olympiad tournaments are rigorous academic interscholastic competitions 
that consist of a series of individual and team events which students prepare for during the year. 
The competitions have a similar format to such other competitive academic events as the national 
debating competition, academic decathlon or spelling bee. 

       Competitions include constructing a wheeled vehicle that is calibrated to travel between 5 
and 10 meters; building test rockets made of plastic pop bottles; constructing the lightest bridge 
to carry a maximum standard load; identifying and classifying fossil specimens; and identifying 
constellations and solving astronomy problems. 

       I admire that Cal Poly Pomona is willing to help promote student interest in 
mathematics, science and engineering, said Ed Rodevich, director of the California State 
Science Olympiad-South. This program allows students to think at a deeper level. Its more than 
factoids, but thinking, reasoning and analyzing. 

       Everyone here is a winner, added Rodevich, who is also coordinator of Mathematics & 
Science K-12 in the Orange County Department of Education. Whats most important isnt if 
you go onto nationals, but if you pushed yourself and your knowledge. 

       Helping with the logistics and organization of the massive events will be several dozen 
Cal Poly Pomona faculty, staff and students; and volunteers from Boeing International and 
Edison International. The event represents a partnership between education and businesses, 
including Biomedix, Boeing International, CNC Engineering, Edison International, Regent 
Properties and Trade Union International.

    CAL POLY POMONA STUDENTS TEACH LOCAL YOUTHS THAT COLLEGE  
        IS WITHIN REACH; NEXT EVENT AT MARSHALL MIDDLE SCHOOL 
 
              Some schoolchildren and their parents believe a college education is out of reach and 
unfeasible. However, a group of marketing students at Cal Poly Pomona are working to break 
that misconception through the Rock Your Future campaign, which will be making a stop at 
Marshall Middle School in Pomona on April 21, from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Rock Your Future 
encourages, motivates and educates high school and middle school students about the 
accessibility of higher education.  

              Through a partnership with the College Preparation Seminar, a panel of specialists is 
brought to the local schools to demystify college. The panelists provide to the children as well as 
their parents tips on planning for college and staying motivated, and emphasize the importance 
of earning good grades in their classes.  

        The marketing students then follow-up with visits to classrooms. Through these more 
personalized exchanges, they reinforce the importance of education, share their college 
experiences and encourage students to study, earn good grades and set goals.  

              This is a win-win project, said Joyce Emilio, a lecturer in the international business and 
marketing department who advises the marketing group. We are trying to build hope and a 
vision for the future that will motivate these students to reach higher, be better students, and be 
more prepared for college and employment. Our students benefit because they gain more 
experience making presentations, polish their interpersonal skills and learn the importance of 
giving back to the community. 

              For more information about Rock Your Future, call Emilio at (909) 869-4545.

            CAL POLY POMONA WINS SEVENTH CONSECUTIVE AWARD  
            AT THE NATIONAL MODEL UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE 

                                                        
       Cal Poly Pomonas 2004 National Model United Nations (NMUN) team accomplished 
another stellar performance at the annual NMUN conference, held April 5-10 in New York City. 
The team won a coveted Outstanding Delegation Award, the highest honor presented by the 
national conference. For the fourth consecutive year, the team won an Outstanding Position 
Paper Award. In addition, Cal Poly Pomona graduate Jennifer Franco assumed the position of 
NMUN SecretaryGeneral, the top administrator of the entire conference. 

       This is the seventh straight year that Cal Poly Pomona has been an award-winner at the 
NMUN, the largest student-administered conference in the country. In 2004, the conference 
attracted its largest number of participants. More than 3,000 students from universities in the 
United States and from 23 different foreign countries attended. About 40 percent of the student 
delegates were from overseas, highlighting the cosmopolitan character of this conference.  

       Cal Poly Pomona represented the country of Syria this year. In a rigorous preparatory 
course, students studied the history, culture, demography, politics and foreign policy of Syria, the 
history and activities of the United Nations, world geography and current world affairs, and the 
rules and procedures of international diplomacy.  

       Students also were granted a briefing session with the Syrian Consulate in Newport 
Beach and, while in New York, received a briefing at the Syrian Mission to the United Nations, 
where Ambassador Fayssal Mekdad conversed with students for two hours. Ambassador Mekdad 
had served as president of the Security Council during the difficult summer months of 2003, 
when the Iraqi incursion was of uppermost concern to the Council (and to the world).

       Cal Poly Pomonas 16-member team represented Syria on eight of the 24 committees, 
organizations, councils, and specialized agencies simulated at the conference. In addition, one of 
the universitys students was selected to serve on the 15-member International Court of Justice. 

       The Outstanding Delegation Award places Cal Poly Pomona in the top 3 percent of 
colleges and universities who send their best students to the conference. The Outstanding 
Position Paper Award is presented for the research papers individual students must submit a 
month prior to the conference, detailing⎯with consummate style and skill and considerable 
data⎯the Syrian position on complex issues of international relations. 

       This year, the respected position of NMUN Secretary-General⎯the top administrator of 
the entire conference⎯was Cal Poly Pomona graduate Jennifer Franco. An honor graduate from 
the political science department, Franco is currently working for the California State Senate. She 
was a student delegate on the universitys award-winning 1999 Lebanon team, and was head 
delegate for the 2000 Finnish team, which she guided to a Distinguished Delegation award.  

       Student members of this years team and their hometowns are:  
       •  Sara Shokravi (head delegate), Glendora    •  Ramona Montayne, Claremont  
       •  Astineh Arakelian, Glendale                •  Raymond Muro,  Cerritos  
       •  Natalie M. Carlson, Glendale               •  Paul T. Nurre, Upland

       •  Thomas L. Majich II, Pasadena              •  Daniel F. Yuhasz, Norco 

       Faculty Adviser John Moore, professor of History, noted that this group of students 
performed at the highest academic and diplomatic level imaginable while at the same time 
demonstrating a sophistication, sense of humor, and collegial spirit that made my New York visit 
one of the most memorable of the many years I have attended the NMUN. We worked hard, 
enjoyed one anothers company, were recognized as a delegation of the highest quality, and 
proudly represented our university.

                 CAL POLY POMONA STUDENTS DISH UP BOOK DRIVE  
                     FOR NEWLY OPENED CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL 
 

              Cal Poly Pomona students in The Collins School of Hospitality Management are helping 
to collect library books for the newly-developed School of Arts and Enterprise. Students in HRT 
383, the class that runs dinner shifts at the Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch on campus, will collect 
new and used books of fiction and nonfiction that are suitable for young adult readers. To 
sweeten the deal, guests who donate a book during dinner will receive a complimentary Apple 
Crisp dessert, a restaurant favorite served with Dr. Bobs Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream. 

        Students hope to collect 1,000 books for the School of Arts and Enterprise, a tuition-free 
public charter high school located in the Pomona Arts Colony. 

        It's important to give back to the community, said Ben Dewald, associate professor in 
The Collins School of Hospitality Management. To involve the community and do some charity 
work will improve the students business, and also inspire student staff to be more responsible 
and happy about their job. 

        The book drive and free Apple Crisp promotion will extend through the end of the spring 
quarter. The Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch is open for lunch at 11:30 a.m. Mondays through 
Fridays until June 4, and open for dinner at 6 p.m. Wednesdays through Saturdays until June 5. 

        For reservations at the Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch, call (909) 869-4700.

       M IDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FIGHT FOR                           S TATE    T ITLE AND  
     BID TO NATIONALS AT             S CIENCE     O  LYMPIAD AT CAL POLY POMONA  

              Some of the top middle and high school students in Southern California will converge at 
Cal Poly Pomona on Saturday, May 1, to compete for a state title in the SCIENCE 
OLYMPIAD. The top scoring middle and high school teams will move on to represent Southern 
California at the national competition in Huntingdon, Penn. from May 21-22. 

        Teams of students representing nearly 50 schools will match wits in competitions that 
cover a wide range of fields in science such as forestry, mechanical engineering and cellular 
biology. Science Olympiad competitions will take place from 8:45 a.m. to 2:45 p.m., with the 
awards ceremony scheduled at 6 p.m.  

        Defending national champion Troy High School (Orange County) will be among the 24 
participating high schools vying for a bid to the nationals. In the middle school division, El 
Rancho Charter School (Orange County) is back to see if they can improve their impressive third 
place finish at last years nationals  but first they have to face fierce competition from 23 
Southern California schools.  

         Cal Poly Pomona is proud to host the Science Olympiad and these exceptional 
students, said University President Michael Ortiz. The university and the Science Olympiad 
share a common appreciation for hands-on learning, which engages students in the process of 
applying textbook knowledge to real world problems.

Cal Poly Pomona  State Science Olympiad 
Page 2 of 3 

       The Science Olympiad tournaments are rigorous academic interscholastic competitions 
that consist of a series of individual and team events which students prepare for during the year. 
The competitions have a similar format to such other competitive academic events as the national 
debating competition, academic decathlon or spelling bee. 

       Competitions include constructing a wheeled vehicle that is calibrated to travel between 5 
and 10 meters; building test rockets made of plastic pop bottles; constructing the lightest bridge 
to carry a maximum standard load; identifying and classifying fossil specimens; and identifying 
constellations and solving astronomy problems. 

       I admire that Cal Poly Pomona is willing to help promote student interest in 
mathematics, science and engineering, said Ed Rodevich, director of the California State 
Science Olympiad-South. This program allows students to think at a deeper level. Its more than 
factoids, but thinking, reasoning and analyzing. 

       Everyone here is a winner, added Rodevich, who is also coordinator of Mathematics & 
Science K-12 in the Orange County Department of Education. Whats most important isnt if 
you go onto nationals, but if you pushed yourself and your knowledge. 

       Helping with the logistics and organization of the massive events will be several dozen 
Cal Poly Pomona faculty, staff and students; and volunteers from Boeing International and 
Edison International. The event represents a partnership between education and businesses, 
including Biomedix, Boeing International, CNC Engineering, Edison International, Regent 
Properties and Trade Union International.

               CAL POLY POMONA DOWNTOWN CENTER SHOWCASES  
            FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING BY SCULPTOR SHIRLEY MOSS 
                                                     
       Who:   Award-wining American Sculptor Shirley Moss, who has pieces in the 
                permanent collections of places such as the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Ohio 
                and the Du Sable Museum in Illinois comes to Pomona to share her work in a 
                solo show. 

      What:   Figuratively Speaking, is an exhibit of Moss bronze and glass sculpture work.  
                Moss' pieces explore issues of identity and a range of emotionsfrom 
                introspective to empowering, and even whimsical.  Moss work is at once 
                delicate and powerful, moving and playful.  The scope of her work encompasses 
                abstract, figurative, tabletop, and commissioned public art.  She continues to 
                explore new concepts, techniques and materials in an effort to keep her 
                presentations fresh and original but still keeping a firm grasp on traditional 
                techniques. 
      When:   Exhibit runs May 8 - 31. Opening reception is May 8, 6 p.m.  9 p.m. The 
                opening reception, scheduled May 8, from 6-9 p.m., is held in conjunction with 
                the Arts Colonys Second Saturday Artwalk event with free gallery openings, 
                live music, shops and restaurants all in a 6 block radius. 

     Where:   Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center, 300 W. Second Street, in Pomona. 

  Ticketing:  Both the reception and the exhibit are open to the public, free of charge.

                    CONFERENCE AT CAL POLY POMONA MAY 14-15  
 
        Particularly during times of international conflict, war is often studied and debated. An

various levels: personal, familial, communal, national and international. The upcoming 
conference will highlight successful experiments in the practical applications of ahimsa.

       GIS is a specialized database designed to store, manipulate and link all forms of 
geographic information. GIS can tie together different data sets (such as hydrology, road 
networks, urban mapping, land cover and demographic data) to provide spatial context. Cal Poly 
Pomonas Center for Geographic Information Systems Research supports GISrelated activities 
on campus, with an emphasis on instruction, research and consulting. The center is responsible 
for promoting spatial literacy within the university through training and lab centered coursework.  

       Cal Poly Pomona is located at 3801 W. Temple Ave. in Pomona. Parking permits are

      $1.3 MILLION GRANT FROM HOWARD HUGHES MEDICAL INSTITUTE 
               EXPANDS SCIENCE EDUCATION AT CAL POLY POMONA 
 
        Students will learn biology in new ways at Cal Poly Pomona thanks to a generous $1.3 
million grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI).   

        HHMI is helping colleges meet the challenges in teaching science today. New fields that 
blur the lines between disciplines are emerging, and biologists, chemists, physicists and 
mathematicians are forging interdisciplinary collaborations. Scientists must be trained to be both 
outstanding researchers as well as teachers. More minorities must be encouraged to pursue 
scientific careers.    

        Receiving this award is recognition of the outstanding work our faculty has done in 
enhancing the way students learn biology here at Cal Poly Pomona, said Dr. Donald Straney, 
dean of the College of Science at Cal Poly Pomona. With this grant, we will be able to give our 
students an even stronger, hands-on preparation for successful careers in the life sciences. And 
we will make connections with other universities that are also deeply committed to improving 
the quality of undergraduate education. 

        Cal Poly Pomonas four-year grant will support a wide range of programs to improve 
undergraduate science, from new courses in hot fields such as bioinformatics and computational 
biology to research-apprenticeship programs that increase opportunities for students to conduct 
original research. The university will also work with teachers of underrepresented and 
disadvantaged students from low-performing schools to enhance science education and teacher 
preparation through week-long workshops and training programs.

Cal Poly Pomona  $1.3 Million Grant for Science Education 
Page 2 of 2 

        

       Undergraduate biology is not well-funded nationally, noted Stephen Barkanic, director of 
HHMIs undergraduate science education program. Public and private funders tend to focus 
their support on research programs, infrastructure and graduate training, but undergraduate 
biology tends to be neglected. Smaller colleges and universities, in particular, often are 
overlooked in the intensive competition for grant dollars.  

       Cal Poly Pomona was among 198 public and private baccalaureate and masters 
institutions invited by HHMI to compete for the new awards. The invited institutions were 
selected for their record of preparing students for graduate education and careers in research, 
teaching or medicine. A panel of distinguished scientists and educators reviewed proposals and 
recommended the 42 awards approved by HHMIs Board of Trustees on May 4.

         CLAREMONT RESIDENT DR. BOB SMALL NAMED INTERIM DEAN  
              FOR COLLINS SCHOOL OF HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT 
 
        Dr. Bob Small has assumed the responsibilities of interim dean for The Collins School of 

Hospitality Management until a national search for the permanent position is complete, said Dr. 

Tomás Morales, interim provost and vice president for Academic Affairs. The dean position was 

vacated when Dr. James Burke recently elected to return to a faculty position in the school.  

        I would like to thank Tomás as well as my colleagues in The Collins School for their 

confidence and support of my candidacy, Small said. This will be a terrific year for the school 

as we continue to build on the momentum that has made our program one of the best in the 

nation. 

        Small has shared an extraordinary legacy with The Collins School. A faculty member 

since 1979, he was the founding dean when the program achieved independent school status in 

1991. Small was instrumental in the growth of the hospitality program at Cal Poly Pomona, 

particularly in program/curriculum development, fund raising, and design of the complex. 

        Bob will provide wonderful leadership for the school during the next year, said 

Morales. His experience in the deans position will be invaluable as The Collins School 

addresses many important issues. I would like to personally commend the faculty and staff of the 

school for participating in this consultative process.  more 

      CAL POLY POMONA VICE PRESIDENT, A RESIDENT OF CLAREMONT, 

                    COMPLETES HACU LEADERSHIP FELLOWSHIP 

                                                  
           Claremont resident Dr. Tómas Morales, provost and vice president of academic 
   affairs at Cal Poly Pomona, has completed a year as participant in the Kellogg MSI 
   Leadership Fellows Program as a Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) 
   fellow. The program is aimed at preparing more Hispanics to be senior administrators in 
   higher education.  

           In addition, Morales was one of 29 university administrators selected to participate in 
   the sixth annual Millennium Leadership Initiative (MLI). MLI is designed to strengthen both 
   the preparation and the eligibility of persons who are traditionally underrepresented in 
   college and university presidencies. Supported by the American Association of State 
   Colleges and Universities (AASCU), the Institute was held June 2629 in Washington, D.C.  

           "Although I've been working in higher education for 29 years, I believe that one 
   should continue learning throughout their career," said Morales. "These programs have been 
   invaluable experiences, particularly the opportunity to explore current issues in higher 
   education with my peers."   

           The HACU Leadership Fellows Program, from which Morales graduated June 5 in 
   Mexico City, selects ten fellows every year and provides them with training aimed at 
   developing the leadership skills needed to be a successful senior-level administrator. The 
   HACU Leadership Fellows Program also focuses on developing skills needed to manage 
   issues unique to Hispanic Serving Institutions.  

           The MLI Institute is a four-day leadership development experience that provides 
   professional development sessions and a mentoring program that introduces participants to 
   mentors who are current or former presidents and chancellors who provide career guidance 
   as well as serve as sponsors and advocates.

       Thousands of miles between friends and family members of Cal Poly Pomona graduates

of commencement 2004 on the Internet. 

       Since commencement ceremonies June 11-13, the live Webcasts and downloads have

the Pacific Islands. 

       I&IT Learning is proud to stream our wonderful commencement so that family and 
friends around the world can join their loved ones as they celebrate their accomplishments at Cal 
Poly Pomona, says David Levin, director of I&IT Learning.  

       The university has provided streaming video of commencement ceremonies since 2001, 
with a steadily increasing audience. Each year, staff members have added additional features to 
the streaming. This year, the nine-member team who worked long hours to produce live video 
added a tree-mounted camera that provided up-close shots of the commencement podium.

       EXHIBIT AT A+D MUSEUM HIGHLIGHTS SIGNIFICANT HISTORY OF 
              CAL POLY POMONAS NEUTRA VDL RESEARCH HOUSE II 
 
       Architect Richard Neutra gave Southern California some of its best modern houses 
including the Kauffman House near Palm Springs (1946) and Moore House in Ojai (1952).  An 
exhibit at the A+D (Architecture and Design) Museum will highlight the famed architects own 
Silverlake residence, the Neutra VDL Research House II, which is being preserved by Cal Poly 
Pomona for public study and use. 

       The exhibit on the design, construction and history of the Neutra VDL Research House II 
will be held now through Sept. 9 at the A+D Museum in West Hollywood. An opening reception 
is scheduled Aug. 5, from 68 p.m.  

       Organizers hope raising awareness about the Neutra VDL Research House will generate 
support for its preservation and rehabilitation. With only a small endowment, Cal Poly Pomona 
has struggled to preserve the historic home, which is suffering from structural and water 
problems that have resulted in some deterioration of interior finishes. An estimated $1 million is 
needed to stabilize and rehabilitate the house.  

       Some innovative features of the house are currently being restored, including the LemLar 
Sun Louver System on the west façade, under the supervision of Neutra VDL Research House 
director Ken McCown, a Cal Poly Pomona assistant professor. 

              Neutra designed and built the original VDL house in 1932 at 2300 Silverlake Blvd. in 
Los Angeles, adding a small house at the rear of the property in 1939. The house is named after 
Cornelius H. van de Leeuw, a Dutch industrialist who met Neutra in Europe and offered to make 
him a loan so that the young architect could build an experimental house for himself and his 
family. The house was designed for living and working close to nature in an urban residential

district. The three-story main house faces the lake: work spaces are on the ground floor, with the 
main living spaces above and a small penthouse surrounded by a deck at the top. The main house 
and the one-story structure at the rear both open onto a central courtyard. To maximize the built 
space on the site, Neutra extended the buildings from lot-line to lot-line. Views through the 
houses and across the courtyard, decks and balconies extend the small spaces beyond their 
boundaries. Neutra convinced a number of manufacturers to donate new materials for him to use 
in the house, in exchange for the publicity his radical modern design was likely to generate. 
       An electrical fire destroyed the main house in 1963. Neutra rebuilt the studio/residence 
on the existing foundations and subfloor with his son and partner, architect Dion Neutra. After 
Richard Neutra died in 1970, his wife Dione continued to live in the house. In 1979, she and Cal 
Poly Pomona agreed that the house would be left to the university after her death so that it could 
be preserved for public study and use. Dion Neutra has remained active as a practitioner and has 
continued to work with Cal Poly Pomona to maintain the house and its legacy. The significance 
of the house was recognized in 1999 when it was designated a World Monument 2000 by the 
World Monument Watch Society.  
       Tours of the Neutra VDL Research House II are available by appointment only. For more 
information or to schedule a tour of the house, e-mail McCown at kmccown@csupomona.edu or 
call (323) 953-0224.  
       The A+D Museum exhibit was co-curated by two Cal Poly Pomona faculty: Lauren 
Weiss Bricker, assistant professor of architecture, and Judith Sheine, department chair and 
professor of architecture. Architecture students Omrana Ahmed, Adam Pollonais, Faisal Ali 
Rajper, Daniel Romero and Ken Wong were also enlisted to help. The A+D Museum is located 
at 8560 W. Sunset Blvd. in West Hollywood. For museum hours, call (310) 659-2445.

             CAL POLY UNIVERSITIES UNVEIL ELEFUN TIME, THEIR  
         57 TH
               FLOAT ENTRY INTO THE TOURNAMENT OF ROSES PARADE  
 
        The year may only be halfway through, but Cal Poly Universities in Pomona and San 
Luis Obispo already have their eyes on New Years Day.  

        The two universities Rose Float Associations have finalized the design for their 57th 
entry into the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Parade, Elefun Time. The float entry depicts a 
family of elephants enjoying a country joy ride to the song The Baby Elephant Walk. The 
eldest son leads the pack on a scooter while his younger brother tags along on a tricycle. Their 
mother and father ride tandem, pulling their young daughter in a wagon. Nearby, several mice 
children are also at play with their mother watching carefully from their tree stump home. 

        The float entry was designed to match the Pasadena Tournament of Roses 2005 theme, 
Celebrate Family.  In considering the parade theme, the students wanted to create a float that 
would also celebrate their love of laughter.  

        About two dozen students from Cal Poly Pomona and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo work on 
the Rose Float year round. The two campuses, located approximately 225 miles apart, manage to 
coordinate the effort to complete the float for each parade. Throughout the 12-month period, both 
student committees work closely together on the design and construction of their respective 
portion to ensure the float is built to specification.  

        Students from the two universities have designed, constructed, decorated and financed 
entries to the Tournament of Roses Parade every year since 1949. Involvement in this project 
highlights the Cal Poly Universities learn-by-doing philosophy as students develop these 
decorative floats from design conception to welding together steel and pasting petals to driving 
the contraption down Colorado Boulevard.

    CAL POLY POMONA HISTORY PROFESSOR (OF CLAREMONT) RECEIVES  
   FULBRIGHT DISTINGUISHED CHAIR AWARD FOR POSITION IN HUNGARY 
 
       Cal Poly Pomona History professor John A. Moore, Jr., has been appointed the László 
Országh Distinguished Chair in American Studies by the Fulbright Distinguished Chairs 
Program. This fall, he will join the faculty of humanities at Péter Pázmány Catholic University, 
in the village of Piliscsaba, just on the northwest edge of Budapest, Hungary. 

       A resident of Claremont, Moore will be one of the approximately 800 U.S. faculty and 
professionals who travel abroad annually to some 140 countries through the Fulbright program.  

       While in Hungary, Moore will teach seminars on American Intellectual History and 
The United States Since 1945 and give guest lectures. The appointment will represent Moores 
second Fulbright stint. In 1999, he was Senior Fulbright Lecturer/Scholar in Finland.  

       Established in 1946 under legislation introduced by the late Senator J. William Fulbright, 
the programs purpose is to build mutual understanding between the people of the United States 
and other countries. This is Americas flagship international educational exchange activity and is 
sponsored by the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.  

       Over its 57 years of existence, the program has provided for thousands of faculty and 
professionals to study, teach, and research abroad, while thousands of their counterparts from 
other countries have engaged in similar activities in the U.S. The Fulbright Scholar Program 
administers 37 Distinguished Chairs in 13 countries.  

       Recipients of Fulbright Scholar awards are selected on the basis of academic or 
professional achievement and have demonstrated extraordinary leadership in their fields.   

       According to the Council for International Exchange of Scholars web site: Awards in 
the Fulbright Distinguished Chairs Program are viewed as among the most prestigious 
appointments in the Fulbright Scholar Program. Candidates should have a prominent record of 
scholarly accomplishment.

          HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY EXPERTS TO EXPAND RESEARCH AT  
  CAL POLY POMONAS COLLINS SCHOOL OF HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT  
                                                    
       After an intensive international search, The Collins School of Hospitality Management at 
Cal Poly Pomona will welcome two new experts who will help the school push its research 
program to new heights. Bringing with them decades of experience in the hospitality industry as 
well as research, Dr. Cathy Hsu and Dr. Denny Rutherford will take different roles in expanding 
the schools research as its first Collins School Endowed Chairs. 

       Beginning in August, Hsu will serve as an advisor to faculty members throughout the 
year. Hsu made her first visit to campus earlier this month to meet with faculty and discuss 
individual and group projects in progress as well as help identify publishing opportunities. She 
will also interview some Collins Schools Board of Advisors interested in working with The 
Collins School to identify applied research opportunities.     

       Rutherford will perform a baseline study that provides an objective perspective on how 
the Collins School compares to other hospitality programs research efforts and then explore how 
and what would be most valuable to the mission and goals of The Collins School.  In his study 
Rutherford will conduct interviews to determine the research environment at Cal Poly Pomona, 
evaluate the potential for involving students, and assist faculty in evaluating possible 
collaborators for research from within the university and outside of the university. 

       There are a number of Collins School faculty who are active in research and scholarship, 
but we believe its important to continue to strengthen our program, said Dr. Bob Small, interim 
dean of The Collins School. We feel privileged that both professors Hsu and Rutherford will 
join the university, he added. They are leaders in the area of research and scholarship in the 
field of hospitality who will aggressively move our research and scholarly program forward.  

       The Collins School Endowed Chair was funded by a generous donation by Jim and Carol 
Collins, long time university benefactors.

       Cal Poly Pomona ranked among the top universities in the West in the newly released 
2005 edition of Americas Best Colleges by U.S. News & World Report. 
       The university placed fifth on the list of Top Public Universities-Masters in the 
Western United States, which includes all public schools whose highest degrees are bachelors 
and masters. Among both public and private universities, it ranked 35    th
                                                                            in the top tier of 
Western universities with undergraduate and masters programs.  
       The universitys diversity was also acknowledged. With a diversity index of 0.68only 
0.05 from the most diverse university in the nationCal Poly Pomona boasts the fifth most 
diverse student body in the Western region, in a tie with Houston Baptist University.  
       The universitys College of Engineering earned additional honors, ranked 14th in the 
nation on the list of Best Undergraduate Engineering Programs.  
       Weve always been proud of the quality, affordable education we provide at Cal Poly 
Pomona, said university President J. Michael Ortiz. Despite the challenge of the state fiscal 
crisis, Cal Poly Pomona remains positioned as a premier regional university. We appreciate the 
fact that our peers have recognized our faculty and staff, a group committed to providing our 
students with an outstanding learning experience. 
       Rankings are calculated by surveying deans and senior faculty from schools nationwide, 
who rated each program they were familiar with on a scale from 1 (marginal) to 5 
(distinguished). Cal Poly Pomona received a peer assessment score of 3.2.  
       Located on 1,438 acres in Southern California, Cal Poly Pomona is part of the 23-campus 
California State University system. Its 2,500 faculty and staff serve close to 20,000 students. One

    CAL POLY POMONA DOWNTOWN CENTER GALLERY FEATURES ARTIST 
         SONIA BLACKMANS INNER IMAGES, OUTWARD EXPRESSIONS 
 
       Who:   Artist and professor emeritus Dr. Sonia Blackman began her art career at the age 
                of 16, when she received scholarships to the Art Students League and New 
                School for Social Research in Woodstock and New York City. Since then, 
                Blackman has had numerous group exhibits and several one-woman exhibits.  

      What:   The Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Centers next exhibit Inner Images, Outward 
                Expressions showcases Blackmans ceramics and pen and ink illustrations. 
                Blackman's pieces not only reveal her training as a psychologist, but also her 
                innate ability to articulate on paper and in clay the many facets of a psyche. The 
                imagery Blackman creates is at once inherently personal and universally 
                accessible and timeless.  

      When:   Saturday, Sept. 1130, with the opening reception Sept. 11, from 69 p.m.  

     Where:   Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center  
                300 W. Second St., in the Pomona Arts Colony 

       Why:  The Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center offers free entry to its gallery, located 
                in the heart of the Pomona Arts Colony. The opening reception is held in 
                conjunction with the Arts Colonys Second Saturday Artwalk event, which 
                features gallery openings, live music, shops and restaurants, all in a six-block 
                radius. 

  Ticketing:  Both the reception and the exhibit are open to the public, free of charge.

      WHAT:   The council will host its quarterly luncheon meeting, this time focusing on the 
                  topic Foreclosures Will Increase 1,500 Percent Between 2005 and 2010. 
                  The featured speaker will be Bruce Norris, president of The Norris Group, a 
                  company dedicated to the profitability and education of California real estate 
                  investors. Norris will discuss his 1997 prediction that California home prices 
                  will double between 1997 and 2005, which turned out to be highly accurate. In 
                  addition, he will explain why he now predicts a record number of home loan 
                  foreclosures and a decrease in home prices. 

                  Cal Poly Pomona professor of finance, real estate and law Michael Carney will 
                  also present an update of real estate trends through the second quarter 2004,

                  developing and distributing factual information about conditions affecting real 
                  estate in Southern California, from housing to mortgage lending and 
                  construction.

               IP3 AND CAL POLY POMONA TEAM UP TO LAUNCH  
             OUTREACH EDUCATION WORKSHOP WITH LEADING  
               INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY EXPERT 
 
 
              SAGINAW, MI  California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, is hosting IP3 Inc., 

the nations leader in Information Assurance and Information Security education and research 

for a two-day workshop.  From Strategy to Reality: Managing the Porous Perimeters will be 

offered Tuesday and Wednesday, Oct. 5-6, in the Cal Poly Pomona Bronco Student Center, 

Ursa Minor Room. The public is invited to attend this workshop along with Cal Poly Pomona 

faculty, staff and students.  

      The workshop is hosted by the Cal Poly Pomona Instructional & Information 

Technology Division and the College of Business Administration, and was initiated by Dr. Dan 

Manson, Computer Information Systems (CIS) professor and campus information security 

officer.  This workshop reflects our continued commitment to, and leadership role in, 

providing high quality information assurance education and training, says Manson. We hope 

to continue this type of collaborative effort for future events.  

                                                                                       1
          Ken Kousky, IP3 CEO says, Cal Poly Pomona is committed to bringing vital 

educational programs to the local market, and our IT security seminar perfectly compliments 

their commitment.  Working with Cal Poly Pomona is a tremendous opportunity.  With cyber 

security a top issue for U.S. corporations and government, information technology education is 

critical.   

       Cooperative efforts with NIST, federal methodology and practical experiences provide 

a foundation for the curriculum and strategies presented.  The E-Government  Act of 2002 

mandates Federal agencies to perform security assessments.  These assessments represent the 

only publicly available systematic review of information assurance and IT security in place 

today, says Kousky.  Both private industry and government can gain a wealth of insight from 

this work, but it may take the creative analysis of a seasoned private industry executive to 

provide a guide to the lessons learned.  

       IP3s workshop provides a balance of theory and real-case scenarios demonstrating how 

security systems have been breached and what solutions are out there to prevent it from 

happening to your business or organization.     

       Sponsored by ISC(2) and CompTIA, no single two-day workshop provides as much 

management and leadership insight for the struggling IT security professional, says Kousky. 

       From Strategy to Reality: Managing the Porous Perimeters explores the latest critical 

security items such as the NIST Guidelines to help Federal agencies fortify their systems, 

SANS/FBI Top 20 Vulnerabilities and the Presidents National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace. 

In addition, the workshop addresses the top five IT security challenges identified by corporate 

security managers: multi-vendor integration, wireless device security, spam, internal theft of 

                                                                                             2
intellectual property, and Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, along with cryptography, PKI, mobile 

computing security, and digital rights management.   

       Pomona is one of 20 cities IP3 will visit during its 2004 national workshop tour.  Cost 

to attend the seminar is $795.  For course outline, registration information and event location

technologies, visit www.ip3seminars.com.

 KELLOGG UNIVERSITY ART GALLERY AT CAL POLY POMONA SHOWCASES 
                  NATIONAL EXHIBIT OF DIGITAL ARTISTS, DPI:2004 
 
        The W. Keith and Janet Kellogg University Art Gallery at Cal Poly Pomona will present 
the national exhibition DPI:2004 from Sept. 20 through Oct. 20. An opening reception for the 
artists is scheduled Thursday, Sept. 30, from 7-9 p.m. Both the reception and exhibit are open 
and free to the public. 
        DPI:2004, or digitally propelled ideas, features 30 artists from across the United States 
who have been actively involved in using computer technology to create works of art. Digital 
technology has opened opportunities for research and experimentation in a number of the art and 
design-related disciplines. The exhibits goal is to bring together the most eclectic experience 
possible. The exhibit will include work from the following disciplines: fine art, graphic design, 
illustration, photography and video. 
        The juror is Carole Ann Klonarides, an international curator of contemporary art, an artist 
and independent producer of experimental documentaries on the arts. She was curator of 
Programming at the Santa Monica Museum of Art from 1997 to 2000. 
        Digital media is totally integrated into our daily lifeso much so that it is again difficult 
for many to embrace digitally propelled ideas as lasting art, said Klonarides. The digital artist 
of today faces many of the same challenges of their predecessors. As the manufacturing of 
videotape comes to an end, the dot-com bubble burst and museums are downsizing media 
departments, perhaps it is time to discard the ruse of the new [in media] and celebrate the 
creative and independent freedom artists have using digital mediaat least for the moment! 
        The Kellogg University Art Gallery is located on the Cal Poly Pomona campus, 3801 W. 
Temple Ave. in Pomona. Parking permits can be purchased for $4 at the Visitor Information 
Booth. A virtual catalog will be online Sept. 20 at www.csupomona.edu/~kellogg_gallery. For 
more information, call Patrick Merrill at (909) 869-4301.

     REPAIRS COMPLETED ON VANDALIZED STUDENT HOUSING BUILDING  
            AT CAL POLY POMONA; VISTA DEL SOL TO OPEN FALL 2004 
 
        After 14 months of careful planning, preparation and reconstruction, Cal Poly Pomona 
has completed the rehabilitation of Vista del Sol, the Residential Suites building that sustained 
extensive water damage by vandals last summer. 

        The building received a certificate of occupancy in August and is ready for students to 
move in on Sept. 22, the day before the start of fall quarter.  

        Rehabilitation involved demolition, air quality testing and then reconstruction of most 
areas of the building. About 30 percent of drywall had been removed from the building, as well 
as all bathroom fixtures, carpeting, showers and kitchen cabinets. Each suite was tested and 
cleared by two teams of environmental industrial hygienists, one working for the university and 
the other for the building contractor. The environmental hygienists used multiple testing criteria 
to confirm the integrity and safety of all spaces in Vista del Sol.  

        The vandalism displaced more than 200 students, who were scheduled to move in for fall 
quarter 2003.  Many of the students were relocated to the Shilo Inn Hotel in Pomona for a 
majority of the academic year, eventually being reassigned to other campus housing as space 
became available.  Damage estimates on the building are unknown and were assumed by the 
general contractor through insurance carried on the facility while under construction.  University 
operating losses are currently assessed at $2.2 million, with most of the losses coming from off-
campus hotel accommodations, storage costs of furnishings, environmental hygienist fees and 
extensions of construction management contracts.  The other Residential Suites building, Vista 
Bonita, was undamaged and opened as planned last fall. 

        After many long hours and a lot of hard work by a lot of people, it is as if Vista del Sol 
had never been touched by the vandals, said Doug Freer, associate vice president for student 
                                              more 

affairs. It was crucial that we took the appropriate time required to deliver a residential facility 
that we are certain is safe and ready for our students.  We are excited about the upcoming 
opening and sharing this state-of-the-art housing community with our students, who have waited 
so patiently while repairs occurred over the last year.  
       Construction of the residential suites began in May 2002. The $26.5 million project 
consists of 111 units in two buildings, housing 410 students. Each suite includes a living room, 
kitchenette area, bedrooms, full-size bathrooms, additional storage space, private 
patios/balconies, and every room is equipped with high-speed Internet and satellite television.  
Each building is also equipped with a two-story general student classroom, which includes a 
private conference room and mezzanine.  
       Vista del Sol was near completion and awaiting the delivery of furniture when it was 
vandalized in summer 2003. An unknown suspect(s) broke in sometime between Tuesday, July 
15, at 5:30 p.m. and Wednesday, July 16, at 6 a.m. The vandal(s) entered nearly every unit in 
Vista del Sol, maneuvered the kitchen sink faucets away from the sink and turned on the water 
full blast. The suspect(s) then ran several large hoses from the ground level through the windows 
of the upper level suite bedrooms, and turned those on as well. Water ran throughout the building 
for approximately eight hours before the construction crew discovered it the next morning.  
       Edge Development, the general contractor, is offering a $20,000 reward for information 
leading to an arrest and conviction of the individual(s) responsible. Those who have any 
information about vandalism of the Residential Suites should contact University Police at (909) 
869-3070.

          CAL POLY POMONA DOWNTOWN CENTER GALLERY PRESENTS  
         PAINTER KEN SHEFFERS POSTCARDS FROM THE ANTIPODES  
 
       Who:   American painter Ken Sheffer, formerly a rocket scientist, shares his lifelong 
                creative passion in this solo exhibit of oil paintings curated by George Cutress. 

      What:   Postcards from the Antipodes, is an exhibit of Sheffers oil paintings.  
                Sheffers command of color and the use of light and shadows in his oil paintings 
                result in amazing value gradients (no air brush here) and a deceptive three 
                dimensionality to each piece.  The natural and abstract collide in Sheffers work.  

      When:   Exhibit runs Saturday, Oct. 6, to Oct. 31. Opening reception is Oct. 9, 69 p.m. 

     Where:   Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center  
                300 W. Second Street, in Pomona. 

       Why:  Visit the Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center, located in the heart of the 
                Pomona Arts Colony. The opening reception is held in conjunction with the Arts 
                Colonys Second Saturday Artwalk event with free gallery openings, live music, 
                shops and restaurants all in a six-block radius. 

  Ticketing:  Both the reception and the exhibit are open to the public, free of charge.

                        MONTH-LONG EVENTS AT CAL POLY POMONA  
               SCHEDULED TO DRAW ATTENTION TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
 
        The American Medical Association estimates that more than 4 million women are victims of 
assaults by their boyfriends or husbands each year. That grim statistic doesnt include children and men 
who are also affected by abuse in the home. To help empower victims of domestic violence, Cal Poly 
Pomona is taking part in national Domestic Violence Awareness Month in October. The following events 
are open to the public. For more information, contact Diane Sands at (909) 869-3102 or 
dcsands@csupomona.edu. 

        Clothesline Project and Hate Crime Memorial 
            The Clothesline Project will be on display in Cal Poly Pomonas University Park on Oct. 5 from 9 
a.m. to 2 p.m. The Clothesline Project is a powerful testimonial from survivors of assault, rape and incest 
who have created several hundred T-shirts that will be hanging on a clothesline. The clothesline 
symbolizes the way their unique stories are strung together to create a shared experience. Airing the shirts 
represents publicly airing society's dirty laundry. Victims of hate crimes will be remembered in the hate 
crime memorial, a series of silhouettes placed throughout the park from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. 

        Womens Self-Defense Class I and II 
            Cal Poly Pomonas Stop Violence Grant Office will hold free self-defense classes for women at 
Java the Hut (Building 71), a university coffee shop located along University Drive on the north-east side 
of campus. The classes are 5:307:30 p.m., with the beginning course scheduled Oct. 5 and the more 
advanced class on Oct. 21. Instructors will focus on prevention and assertiveness training.  

        Visual Voices Against Violence  
            The two-day art exhibit Visual Voices Against Violence will be on display in Cal Poly 
Pomonas W. Keith and Janet Kellogg University Art Gallery Oct. 2627, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. The 
exhibit will feature works by community agencies that use art as a form of healing and bringing 
awareness to the plight of domestic violence and sexual assault. As a part of the event on Oct. 26, at 6 
p.m. a reception will be hosted by the National Organization for Women, Students TALK Peer Educators 
and the ReEntry & WoMens Resource Center. Then, at 7 p.m., there will be a womens Take Back the 
Night March and mens dialogue on How to Stop the Violence.

                CAL POLY POMONA DOWNTOWN CENTER PRESENTS 
         FREE STAGED READINGS OF CLASSIC SHAKESPEARE COMEDIES 
 
       Professional actors will perform free staged readings of Shakespeares classic comedies 
each quarter at the Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center. The readings are scheduled to coincide 
with Second Saturday Family Days in the Pomona Arts Colony, which features family-friendly 
activities including gallery exhibits, arts and crafts.  

       The 2004-05 season begins on Oct. 9, at 7 p.m., with A Midsummer Nights Dream under 
the direction of Peter Uribe, an educator at the Orange County High School of Performing Arts 
and actor/director. On Jan. 8, A Comedy of Errors will be read at 7 p.m. under the direction of 
Lisa Wolpe, founder and artistic director of the Los Angeles Womens Shakespeare Company. 
The spring production on April 9, at 7 p.m., features As You Like It, directed by Cal Poly 
Pomona associate professor and actor Linda Bisesti. 

       While sans props and painted backgrounds, staged readings bring Shakespeare to life in a 
compelling, but non-threatening way. They are an opportunity for community members to enjoy 
a live performance, whether they are new to Shakespeare or fans of the bard.  

       These events are sponsored by Cal Poly Pomona's College of Letters, Arts & Social 
Sciences and presented by the Southern California Shakespeare Festival in collaboration with 
Cal Poly Pomonas theatre department. These staged readings are free, although donations are 
accepted. 

       The Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center exists to serve the Pomona community and to 
be a center of service learning and outreach for the student, faculty and staff of the university. 
The Downtown Center brings education and applied knowledge to downtown Pomona, thereby 
contributing to the economic revitalization of the city. In turn, the campus receives an ongoing 
education in the realities and issues faced by the city of Pomona. The Cal Poly Pomona 
Downtown Center is located at 300 W. Second St. in downtown Pomonas Arts Colony. For 
more information, contact the Downtown Center at (909) 469-0080.

         CAL POLY POMONA STUDENTS HELP RAISE MONEY TO SUPPORT  
                 SECOND HARVEST FOOD BANK OF ORANGE COUNTY 
 
        On Oct. 7, students in Cal Poly Pomonas Collins School of Hospitality Management will 
use their classroom knowledge to make a difference in the community.  

        The 49 students in HRT 281: Professional Cooking Lecture and Lab will host a booth 
and volunteer at the Food, Wine, and Micro-Brew Festival at South Coast Plaza on Oct. 7. 
Students will work alongside an array of restaurants at the event, which raises money for the 
Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County.  

        The Collins School students will serve samples of desserts, including rich double 
chocolate fudge brownies, pecan tarts on a sugar cookie crust, and pumpkin squares dotted with 
macadamia nuts and white chocolate morsels. These confections were created in the Collins 
School kitchen lab as part of the students classes on baking.   

        This is what teaching is all about, said class instructor Dr. Sandy Kapoor. You really 
feel like you have made a difference. You have changed livesyour own, your students and 
your communitys. 

        The class decided to participate in the community service learning project after learning 
that just $1 raised by Americas Second Harvest would buy 15 meals, and that many of the 
hungry in the community are children.  

        For more information, contact Kapoor at (909) 869-4286.

     MR. AND MRS. HAE PARK GIVE $1 MILLION TOWARD ALUMNI OFFICE 
 AT CAL POLY POMONA COLLINS SCHOOL OF HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT 
 
       Cal Poly Pomona is grateful local entrepreneurs Hae and Shina Park have pledged  
$1 million to create an Alumni Office at the Collins School of Hospitality Management at Cal 
Poly Pomona.  

       Mr. Parks time at Cal Poly Pomona created a lasting, positive experience that has 
translated into a long-term relationship with the university, said Cal Poly Pomona President J. 
Michael Ortiz. The Parks have been incredible supporters. Its because of their kindness and 
generosity that the Collins School will have the resources it needs for continued outreach to other 
students and alumni. 

       Establishing an Alumni Office to encourage and maintain relationships with past and 
present students has special meaning to Mr. Park. As a former Cal Poly Pomona student, he 
struggled with his English when first attending the university. Despite the challenges, he never 
gave up working toward his degrees. For that, he credits his mentor, Dr. Donald Lundberg, who 
encouraged him to continue his education and provided support and guidance along the way.  

       After graduating with a bachelors in hotel and restaurant management in 1978 as well as 
a masters in business administration in 1984, Park went on to own and manage Cal Pacific 
Realty, which operates Bel Air Swap Meet, Pro Swap Meet and a number of other properties.  

       I am truly grateful for the education and guidance I received from Dr. Donald Lundberg 
while attending the Collins School of Hospitality Management, said Mr. Park. I now own and 
manage a successful real estate development business. Its now time to invest in whoever needs 
our help and support.  

       Earlier this year, the Parks established a $20,000 endowed memorial scholarship in honor 
                                              more 

of Lundberg, who taught at Cal Poly Pomona from 197383.  
       The $1 million gift will be matched by longtime university benefactors James and Carol 
Collins. In addition, the University Educational Trust will add $5,000, yielding a $2,005,000 
endowment. The Collins School will establish the Alumni Office within the academic year under 
the direction of a full-time staff member.  
       This gift represents an ideal example of a bond between a faculty member and a student. 
It is given in memory of Dr. Donald Lundberg, who mentored Mr. Park while he was a student, 
said Dr. Bob Small, interim dean of the Collins School. With Mr. and Mrs. Park's generous gift 
we can ensure that the essential relationships between students, alumni and faculty will be 
developed and nurtured. 
       The Parks are residents of Rancho Cucamonga and have two children. Their son, Eugene, 
is a junior at the Collins School. They also have a daughter, Eunice, a junior at Rancho 
Cucamonga High School.

          CAL POLY POMONA DOWNTOWN CENTER GALLERY EXHIBITS  
 RUNNING THROUGH HISTORY BY MULTIMEDIA ARTIST LUCINDA LUVAAS 
 
       Who:      Multimedia artist Lucinda Luvaas has a long history of composite installations 
                 including videos, murals, oil paintings, sculptures and performance pieces.  She exhibits 
                 nationally and internationally and has an extensive body of work.  Luvaas is also 
                 director of Mt. San Jacinto Colleges Fine Art Gallery. 

      What:      Running Through History is an exhibit of Luvaas video pieces and oil paintings. 
                 Luvaas work is timely and provocativeasking questions of the past that resonate with 
                 todays often volatile world. Luvaas wants to investigate history, hoping to connect with 
                 past events in a more meaningful way. When examining her work it is impossible not to 
                 make connections with todays current events and our own roles in history. 

      When:      Exhibit runs Nov. 9Dec. 11.  
                 Free opening reception is Saturday, Nov. 13, 69 p.m. 

     Where:      Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center 
                 300 W. Second St., in Pomona Arts Colony 

       Why:      Visit the Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center, located in the heart of the Pomona Arts 
                 Colonythe opening reception is held in conjunction with the Arts Colonys Second 
                 Saturday Artwalk event with free gallery openings, live music, shops and restaurants all 
                 in a six-block radius. 

  Ticketing:     Both the reception and the exhibit are open to the public, free of charge.

       Due to heavy rains in the region, the 11th annual HARVEST AUCTION benefit, Harvest 
at Kellogg Ranch, will be moved to Kellogg Gymnasium on the Cal Poly Pomona campus.  The

presentations showcasing The Collins School, followed by a Santa Maria-inspired dinner 
prepared and served by Collins School students, alumni and faculty.  

       More than 500 people will gather to support education at The Collins School of 
Hospitality Management while celebrating the best of the wine and food industry.  

        This is an enormously exciting time for the school, said Dr. Bob Small, interim dean 
of The Collins School. Were bridging 30 years of history at this school. Our students, alumni 
and faculty are working hand in hand as we celebrate our founders, our supporters and our 
history. 

       New to Harvest Auction is a Back to School session where attendees will get a flavor 
of The Collins Schools top-ranked program and visit the schools new building additions. A 
beer and wine tasting presented by professors Michael Godfrey and Margie Ferree Jones will 
explore the impact of shifting customer expectations on the wine and beer industry. Professor of 
culinary arts Dr. Sandy Kapoor and her students will prepare and showcase recipes made famous 
by Patrick Terrails legendary restaurant Ma Maison. Professor of management Dr. Ed Merritt, a 
former hospitality executive, will provide an overview of contemporary leadership strategies.

                begins to confide in him, and he learns he must foil a plot by the local KKK chapter. 
                This is the same play in which actor Matthew Broderick is currently playing the title 
                character Off-Broadway.

process and involvement with the Tournament of Roses. In addition, Rose Float Club and 
Committee members will give an entertaining history of the Cal Poly float project and highlight

Rose Float Lab with university President Michael Ortiz and his wife, Betty. 

       Rose Queen Moreno is a 17-year-old senior at La Cañada High School. The 2005 
princesses are: Alaire Hanashian, a 17-year-old senior at Temple City High School; Kara

Baby Elephant Walk. The eldest son leads the pack on a scooter while his younger brother tags 
along on a tricycle. Their mother and father ride tandem, pulling their young daughter in a 
wagon. Nearby, several mice children are also at play with their mother watching carefully from 
their tree stump home. 
       The float entry was designed to match the Pasadena Tournament of Roses 2005 theme, 
Celebrate Family.  In considering the parade theme, the students wanted to create a float that 
would also celebrate their love of laughter.  
       About two dozen students from Cal Poly Pomona and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo work on 
the Rose Float year round. The two campuses, located approximately 225 miles apart, manage to 
coordinate the effort to complete the float for each parade. Throughout the 12-month period, both 
student committees work closely together on the design and construction of their respective 
portion to ensure the float is built to specification.  
       Students from the two universities have designed, constructed, decorated and financed 
entries to the Tournament of Roses Parade every year since 1949. Involvement in this project 
highlights the Cal Poly Universities learn-by-doing philosophy as students develop these 
decorative floats from design conception to welding together steel and pasting petals to driving 
the contraption down Colorado Boulevard. 
       Media representatives are welcome to attend the luncheon and tour the Rose Float Lab.

                    CAL POLY POMONA JAZZ BAND PERFORMANCE  
               FEATURES RENOWNED GUEST ARTIST JEFF CLAYTON 
 
        Renowned jazz musician Jeff Clayton will join the Cal Poly Pomona Jazz Band in a 
special performance directed by university assistant professor Dave Kopplin on Nov. 30 at 8 
p.m. in the universitys Music Recital Hall. 

        Clayton is a leading figure in contemporary music. He studied music at Cal State 
Northridge, but left his formal studies when he joined Stevie Wonder on the road. That 
experience began Claytons career as a touring musician as well as a studio musician. In addition 
to Stevie Wonder, he also recorded albums with Gladys Knight, Kenny Rogers, The 
Temptations, The Four Tops, Michael Jackson, Patti Labelle and Earth, Wind and Fire just to 
name a few.  

        Clayton moved toward jazz over the years. As a sideman he worked for such musical 
titans as Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Ella Fitzgerald, Woody Herman, Lionel Hampton, 
Lena Horne and a short stint with the Count Basie Orchestra.  

        Today, Clayton spends considerable time in the popular big band the Clayton-Hamilton 
Jazz Orchestra, working with his bassist/arranger brother John Clayton and drummer Jeff 
Hamilton. The Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra was named the resident jazz orchestra for the 
Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1999, and the orchestra is the host ensemble for the summer jazz 
series at the Hollywood Bowl. 

        Tickets are $7. For more information or reservations, call (909) 869-3554. Tickets also

              LIFESCAPES INTERNATIONAL GIVES CAL POLY POMONA  
     $10,000 FOR LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE SCHOLARSHIP ENDOWMENT  
 
        A $10,000 gift from Lifescapes International Inc. to Cal Poly Pomona will create 
scholarships for students in the landscape architecture program. The newly established Lifescapes 
International Landscape Architecture Endowment will provide two awards of $500 each year 
beginning May 2005.  

        The generous donation from Lifescapes, and in particular Don and Barbara Brinkerhoff, will 
assist generations of students in achieving a degree in landscape architecture, said Dean Karen 
Hanna. The College of Environmental Design is grateful for the Brinkerhoffs dedication to higher 
education and the preparation of future landscape architects. 

        Lifescapes and Cal Poly Pomona have a long-standing relationship. Over the years, the 
company and its founders, Don and Barbara Brinkerhoff, have given consistently and generously to 
the university. Lifescapes also employs numerous Cal Poly Pomona alumni, who account for 75 to 
80 percent of its designersthe most notable alumnus being Don Brinkerhoff, who is also a fellow in 
the American Society of Landscape Architects. 

        We at Lifescapes have an extended interest in the university, said Julie Brinkerhoff-Jacobs, 
president and CEO of Lifescapes International. We really believe that Cal Poly Pomona produces 
some great graduates and we want to be able to support the continuation of its programs. If more 
people support public education, then more students will receive opportunities to succeed. We can 
only hope our scholarship program will assist students as my father was assisted when he was a Cal 
Poly Pomona student.

resort, residential, timeshare and casino developments worldwide. It has designed and implemented

   EARLY GLIMPSE OF CAL POLY UNIVERSITIES 2005 ROSE PARADE ENTRY  
     OFFERED DURING ROSE FLOAT APPRECIATION & MEDIA DAY DEC. 11 
                                                     
         Who:    The 45-time award-winning Rose Float Club and Committee from the Cal 
                  Poly Universities in Pomona and San Luis Obispo 
        What:   Rose Float Appreciation & Media Day will provide supporters and media an 
                  inside look at Elefun Time, the 2005 Tournament of Roses Parade float, as it 
                  nears completion.  
        When:  Saturday,  Dec. 11, 11 a.m. to noon. 
       Where:   Rose Float Lab (Building 64) at Cal Poly Pomona, located off Citrus Lane. 
                  For maps and parking instructions, call Uyen Mai at (909) 869-5331.  
       Details:  The float entry, which will use animation, depicts a family of elephants 
                  enjoying a country joy ride to the song The Baby Elephant Walk. The eldest 
                  son leads the pack on a scooter while his younger brother tags along on a 
                  tricycle. Their mother and father ride tandem, pulling their young daughter in a 
                  wagon. Nearby, several mice children are also at play with their mother 
                  watching carefully from their tree stump home. The float entry was designed 
                  to match the Pasadena Tournament of Roses 2005 theme, Celebrate Family.  
                  In considering the parade theme, the students wanted to create a float that 
                  would also celebrate their love of laughter.  
Opportunity:  Reporters can interview students from the Pomona and San Luis Obispo 
                 campuses and Rose Float supporters. There will also be photo opportunities 
                  involving the float and its workers.

          CAL POLY POMONA DOWNTOWN CENTER GALLERY PRESENTS  
               JOHN CULLEN: ARTIFACTS, SELECTED WORKS 1992-2004 
 
       Who:      Trained as both an artist and social worker, John Cullen is a poet, songwriter and 
                 multimedia artist.  Cullen came to Los Angeles in 1970 from the Midwest and received 
                 his masters in studio art from Cal State Los Angeles in 1980. Later, he received a 
                 degree from Pacifica Graduate Institute in depth psychology and works as a therapist. 

      What:      Cullens selected works include multimedia collage paintings, sculpture and installation 
                 art. His pieces fold religious and cultural symbology together, resulting in the 
                 expression of memories and emotions usually left unspoken; some inspired by his 
                 clients. His paintings demonstrate a fragility and profound introspection. Cullen is 
                 masterful at communicating what often falls below the radar of human cognizance.   

      When:      The exhibit runs Jan. 4Feb. 19, with an opening reception Jan. 8, from 69 p.m. 

     Where:      Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center, 300 W. Second Street, in Pomona. 

       Why:      Visit the Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center, located in the heart of the Pomona Arts 
                 Colony. The opening reception is held in conjunction with the Arts Colonys Second 
                 Saturday Artwalk event with free gallery openings, live music, shops and restaurants all 
                 in a six-block radius. 

  Ticketing:     Both the reception and the exhibit are open to the public and free of charge.

       UNITY LUNCHEON AT CAL POLY POMONA TO CELEBRATE DIVERSITY 
        AND FEATURE KEYNOTE ON IDENTITY POLITICS BY FILIPINA POET 
         
        The Cal Poly Pomona campus community will come together to celebrate diversity 
during the 14th annual Unity Luncheon, Standing Together:  Many Communities, One 
University. The event is scheduled for Monday, Jan. 31, 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. in the 
universitys Bronco Student Center, Ursa Major Suite.  
        Delivering the keynote address is Alison M. De La Cruz, an artist, poet and cultural 
activist. Currently living in the South Bay, De La Cruz works with emerging and established 
artists to create, transform, mobilize and heal communities through the arts. She has performed 
her poetry and solo theatrical work at venues throughout the country including: the David Henry 
Hwang Theatre in Los Angeles, Bindlestiff Studio in San Francisco, the Northwest Asian 
American Theatre in Seattle and the Asian Arts Initiative in Philadelphia.  
        De La Cruzs address, Belching from Our Centers, addresses the trappings of identity 
politics and community collaborations. She will engage luncheon attendees in an interactive 
performance/keynote address exploring how our individual and collective work can help us belch 
up community blockage caused by fear, misunderstandings and cycles of hurt.

organizations that are advocates and leaders for diversity both on and off campuswill be

           CAL POLY POMONA CLUB WINS TOP STUDENT CHAPTER AWARDS  
          FROM NATIONAL SOCIETY OF HISPANIC PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS 
 
        Out of 205 chapters on college and university campuses in the nation, Cal Poly Pomonas 
Society of Hispanics in Science and Engineering (SHSE) took top honors from the Society of 
Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE). The universitys club was named National Chapter of 
the Year, Regional Chapter of the Year and Outstanding Large Chapter of the Year.  

        The awards were announced during the national convention from Jan. 5-9 in Dallas, 
Texas. Forty-three of the 140 Cal Poly Pomona SHSE members attended the convention. 

        Everyone at our tables was jumping up and down, described Julian Astudillo, SHSEs 
current club president. We were so excited because its a great accomplishment. It will 
definitely help the club out for the next couple of years in terms of giving us inspiration and 
motivation.  

        The national student chapter awards are based on the 2003-04 year-end reports 
summarizing the chapters activities. Chapters are recognized for their ability to exemplify 
SHPEs mission and goals. Last academic year, Cal Poly Pomonas SHSE provided regular 
outreach events for local high schools, food for the homeless and hosted a regional basketball 
tournament to encourage networking among Southern California SHPE student chapters.  

        Aside from picking up awards, the convention provides an opportunity for students to 
network, learn from professionals in the field and gather information about career development 
opportunities. In addition, the groups adviser, professor Hany J. Farran, presented a workshop at 
the conference on earthquake damage.  

        The SHPE strives to promote educational excellence, economic opportunity and social 
equity for Hispanics.

                FORMER COMPBENEFITS CEO NAMED NEW DEAN OF

        Dr. David Klock, who had served as the chief executive officer of the CompBenefits 
Corporation for 11 years, has been named dean of the College of Business Administration. He 
begins his new position on June 13. 

        Bringing David Klock to Cal Poly Pomona means great things for the College of 
Business Administration, said President J. Michael Ortiz.  He reflects the type of leadership 
that distinguishes this university, combining unparalleled corporate experience and a solid 
foundation at the university level. 

        Based in Roswell, Georgia, CompBenefits is one of the nation's leading dental and vision 
benefits companies, serving five million members. Klock retired from the firm in June 2004 after 
11 years. During his tenure as CEO, CompBenefits grew from $40 million in revenue to more 
than $300 million in revenue with industry-leading profit margins.  

        Returning to my roots in education has always been a passion of mine, said Klock.  
Cal Poly Pomona's College of Business Administration is well positioned to make a significant 
impact throughout California and the region.  I look forward to working with all of the talented 
faculty, staff and students. 

        Klock earned his Ph.D. in finance from the University of Illinois, beginning a 
distinguished career in higher education.  He has a total of 18 years of teaching and research 
experience, including five years as chair of the finance department in the College of Business at 
the University of Central Florida. 

        Klock formally replaces Dr. Eduardo Ochoa, who left to become the Provost of Sonoma 
State University in 2003.  Dr. Lynn Turner has served as acting dean for the college during the 
interim.

 WHEN HEAVEN AND EARTH CHANGED PLACES AUTHOR, LE LY HAYSLIP, 
          TO DISCUSS HER EXPERIENCE, HOLD BOOK SIGNING MARCH 1 
                                                        
       Some say that during war, heaven and earth change places. Find out why when best-
selling author Le Ly Hayslip discusses Vietnam Through My Eyes at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, 
March 1, in the Cal Poly Pomona Bronco Student Centers Ursa Major Suite. A book signing 
will follow. 

       Hayslip wrote When Heaven and Earth Changed Places, her award-winning memoirs 
of her life before, during and after the Vietnam War. Her experiences are ranged, starting with a 
happy childhood as a Vietnamese village girl, the destruction of her home, her work with the 
Viet Cong, the torment she endured from both the North and South, her escape to the United 
States and eventual return. She also wrote the sequel Child of War, Woman of Peace, which 
describes her struggle to heal old wounds and start a new life. These books inspired Oliver 
Stones film Heaven and Earth.  

       Today, Hayslip is a popular speaker. In addition, she founded the East Meets West 
Foundation, a humanitarian relief organization that works to rebuild lives on both sides of the 
world.  

       Free and open to the public, the lecture and book signing are sponsored by the Cal Poly 
Pomonas Asian and Pacific Islander Student Center and the ReEntry and Womens Resource 
Center. They are part of universitys Asia and Pacific Islands Heritage Month and Womens 
Herstory Month activities. 

       Cal Poly Pomona is located at 3801 W. Temple Ave. in Pomona. Parking permits are 
required. Daily permits can be purchased for $5 at the Visitor Information Booth along Kellogg 
Drive. For more information, contact Dora Lee at (909) 869-5023.

students, said University President Michael Ortiz. The university and the Science Olympiad 
share a common appreciation for hands-on learning, which engages students in the process of 
applying textbook knowledge to real world problems. 

        The Science Olympiad tournaments are rigorous academic interscholastic competitions 
that consist of a series of individual and team events which students prepare for during the year. 
The competitions have a similar format to such other competitive academic events as the national 
debating competition, academic decathlon or spelling bee. 

        Competitions include constructing a wheeled vehicle that is calibrated to travel between 5 
and 10 meters; building test rockets made of plastic pop bottles; constructing the lightest bridge 
to carry a maximum standard load; identifying and classifying fossil specimens; and identifying 
constellations and solving astronomy problems.

              The Science Olympiad is a celebration of science and science education, said Gary 
Widdison, who coordinates the event for the Los Angeles County Office of Education. In all of 
the events, students must use what they know to solve problems. This is a fundamental core of 
good science education: to learn and understand a concept so well that you can apply it in a new

   REAL LIFE COACH CARTER TO SPEAK TO CAL POLY POMONA STUDENTS 
                    ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCES, ATTAINING SUCCESS 
 
       Who:   Ken Carter, the man who inspired the movie Coach Carter, which is currently in 
                theaters. Carter is the controversial high school basketball coach who made 
                national news in 1999 when he benched his undefeated team due to the players 
                poor academic records. 
      What:   Now an author and motivational speaker, Carter will visit Cal Poly Pomona to 
                speak to students about visualizing and attaining success, winning against all 
                odds, setting goals and putting family first. 
      When:   Carter will visit Cal Poly Pomona Monday, March 7. He will first speak to 
                Bronco athletes from 3-3:45 p.m. The general student population will hear a 
                unique presentation at 5 p.m., followed by a question and answer session. 
                Autographs and a book signing are scheduled at 6:30 p.m. The media will have 
                time for interviews at 7 p.m.   
     Where:   Cal Poly Pomona University Theatre, 3801 W. Temple Ave., Pomona 
       Why:  Carters visit was initiated by professor James Swartzs Marketing the Movies 
                course for entertainment business majors. The class is working with Paramount 
                Pictures toward preparing a business plan for the DVD release of the movie 
                Coach Carter. A number of campus organizations came together to make this 
                event possible: College of Business Administration, Bronco Events and 
                Activities Team, Office of the President, Bronco Athletics, I&IT MediaVision & 
                Studio Six, Theatre Department. 
  Ticketing:  Tickets are free, but are limited to Cal Poly Pomona students. Some seats are 
                being reserved for media representatives. Call for more information.

            BANK OF AMERICA FUNDS PROGRAMS FOR LOCAL YOUTHS 
                  AT THE CAL POLY POMONA DOWNTOWN CENTER 
 
        The College of Letters, Arts & Social Sciences (CLASS) recently received a gift of 
$15,000 from the Bank of America Foundation for after school and summer programs for youth. 
The funding will help to support CLASS's Academy for Literacy Through the Arts program and 
assist in providing fee waivers for students with financial needs. 

        Academy for Literacy Through the Arts, a program headquartered at the Cal Poly Pomona 
Downtown Center, utilizes an innovative approach to learning. Students engage in artistic 
courses that teach them life and job skills while learning to read, write and communicate more 
effectively. 

        Artists, writers, teachers, professors and college students teach classes such as 
cartooning, pastels, Web design, introduction to theater, theater make-up and mask making, and 
the technical aspects of theater.  Instructors have included local photographer Debra Martin, who 
is also a Pomona Arts Commissioner; Marcee Zari, a Whittier photographer whose exhibit in the 
Downtown Center gallery coincided with her class on photography and Photoshop; and author, 
3-D expert and art critic, Ray Zone, who taught courses in film and literature, introducing 
students to classic and current films, while discussing and critically writing about them.   

        After school programs are offered during the academic year and change quarterly.  Last 
summer, the inaugural Summer Academy for the Arts took place with two three-week sessions 
that offered full-day programs for middle school and high school age students.  At the end of 
each quarter or summer session students showcase their artwork and newly found or refined 
talents to the public. 

        The Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center is located at 300 W. Second St. in the Pomona 
Arts Colony.

    CAL POLY POMONA CIS DEPARTMENT EARNS NATIONAL DESIGNATION  
          FOR EXCELLENCE IN INFORMATION ASSURANCE EDUCATION 
        
       The Department of Homeland Security and National Security Agency have honored Cal 
Poly Pomonas Computer Information Systems (CIS) department with the designation National 
Center of Excellence in Information Assurance Education for academic years 2005-2008.  

       Cal Poly Pomona is the only California State University with that designation, and one of 
only four institutions in the state, along with Stanford University, University of California Davis 
and the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey.  

       Cal Poly Pomona submitted the Information Systems Audit option of its Masters of 
Science in Business Administration; and Computer Information Systems concentration (Internet 
Programming and Security track) of its Bachelors of Science in Business Administration. 

       The National Center of Excellence in Information Assurance Education program aims to 
reduce vulnerability in the nations information infrastructure. It honors 4-year colleges and 
graduate-level universities that produce professionals with information assurance expertise in 
various disciplines. During the application process applicants are evaluated against stringent 
criteria and must pass a rigorous review demonstrating its commitment to academic excellence in 
information assurance education. 

       This achievement spotlights the dedicated hard work of Dan Manson [professor], Fred 
Gallegos [lecturer], Steve Curl [department chair] and the entire CIS department, said Dr. Lynn 
Turner, Interim Dean of the College of Business Administration. Over three years ago, this 
team had the vision to develop faculty expertise in this critical area of computer security. They 
sought involvement from industry, government agencies, and formed partnerships with a leading 
R&D laboratory and community colleges. They have developed and delivered state-of-the-art 
curricula on information assurance.  Its wonderful to see all of this hard work recognized. 

       A ceremony to recognize the universitys achievement will be held June 7 at 9:30 a.m.

         CAL POLY POMONA DOWNTOWN CENTER GALLERY PRESENTS  
         BLESSED ARE THESE HANDS, A PHOTOGRAPHIC COLLECTION 
 
       Who:   Claremont photographers Susan Kullmann and Marvelle Thompson have 
                collaborated to create an exhibit of the feminine sacred. Thompson is an artist 
                and teaches art to both adults and children. Kullmann is an artist and research 
                scholar at UCLAs Center for the Study of Women.   

      What:   Blessed Are These Hands is a photographic collection that began as a vow to 
                honor the work and life stages of women. The series of photographs depict the 
                tools women use most in their endeavors: their hands, holding symbols of what 
                they each find sacred in their life.  Some women chose to include statements 
                complementing their pictures, such as a poem or story. The result is a personal 
                and moving display of self and spiritual awareness.  

      When:   The exhibit runs through April 23, with an artist reception April 9, 6-9 p.m. 

     Where:   Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center, 300 W. Second Street, in Pomona. 

       Why:  Visit the Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center, located in the heart of the 
                Pomona Arts Colony. The opening reception is held in conjunction with the Arts 
                Colonys Second Saturday Artwalk event with free gallery openings, live music, 
                shops and restaurants all in a six-block radius. 

  Ticketing:  Both the reception and the exhibit are open to the public and free of charge.

       CAL POLY POMONA TEAMS UP WITH IP3S LEADING INFORMATION 
                             TECHNOLOGY SECURITY EXPERT 
 
        Cal Poly Pomona is hosting IP3 Inc., the nations leader in Information Assurance and 
Information Security education and research, for a two-day workshop which covers both theory 
and practice.  From Strategy to Reality: Implementing a Policy-Centric IT Security Architecture 
will be offered April 25-26 in the Cal Poly Pomona Bronco Student Center, Ursa Minor Room.     

       The workshop is hosted by the Cal Poly Pomona Instructional & Information Technology 
Division and College of Business Administration.   

       This workshop reflects our continued commitment to, and leadership role in, providing 
high quality information assurance education and training, says Dr. Dan Manson, a computer 
information systems professor who helped initiate the workshop. We hope to continue this type 
of collaborative effort for future events.   

       The Department of Homeland Security and National Security Agency recently honored 
Cal Poly Pomonas Computer Information Systems department with the designation National 
Center of Excellence in Information Assurance Education for academic years 2005-2008.  

       Cal Poly Pomona is the only California State University with that designation, and one of 
only four institutions in the state, along with Stanford University, University of California Davis 
and the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey. 

       Ken Kousky, IP3 CEO says, Cal Poly Pomona is committed to bringing vital 
educational programs to the local market, and our IT security seminar perfectly complements 
their commitment.  Working with Cal Poly Pomona is a tremendous opportunity. With cyber 
security a top issue for U.S. corporations and government, information technology education is 
critical.  

       IP3s workshop provides a balance of theory and real-case scenarios demonstrating how

CAL POLY POMONA RECEIVES FUNDING FOR ENTREPRENEURIAL PROJECTS 
               FROM NATIONAL COLLEGIATE INVENTORS ALLIANCE 
 
        From developing a special spoon holder for people struggling with cerebral palsy to 
redesigning a hand operated water pump for leg operation in developing countries, Cal Poly Pomona 
students and faculty are working on socially responsible, entrepreneurial projects thanks to a new 
grant. Cal Poly Pomona received $25,200 from the National Collegiate Inventors & Innovators 
Alliance (NCIIA) to provide seed money for the universitys students and faculty to develop 
commercially viable, entrepreneurial projects that directly benefit local communities. 

        With the help of the NCIIA, engineering and business school educators at Cal Poly Pomona 
are providing students the opportunity for meaningful community involvement through participation 
in carefully selected, socially responsible, team-oriented projects with the potential for commercial 
adaptation.  

        Twenty-five students will be drawn from a variety of engineering disciplines to participate in 
an undergraduate seminar and optional two-quarter design course sequence offered by the College of 
Engineering. Students participate in multidisciplinary teams for a period of at least one academic 
year. They begin by visiting community partner sites, identifying projects, and generating a thorough 
market study, feasibility analysis, and concept design during the undergraduate seminar. During the 
two-quarter design course sequence, students evaluate possible designs from the seminar and develop 
a functional prototype, then test and modify before making a formal presentation of the concept and 
prototype to the community partner. NCIIA funding is made available to teams with projects that 
show commercial potential. 

        NCIIA fosters invention, innovation and entrepreneurship in higher education as a way of 
creating innovative, commercially viable and socially beneficial businesses and employment 
opportunities in the United States. NCIIA is supported by Lemelson Foundation.  

        The proposal for funding was submitted by College of Engineering professors Jawaharlal 
Mariappan and Ravi Vilupanur, and College of Business Administration professor Stanley Abraham.

           BRONCO STUDENT CENTER GALLERY AT CAL POLY POMONA 
       PRESENTS LOCAL ARTISTS CAROL POWELL AND GUSTAVO MUÑIZ 
 
       Who:   Whittier artist Carol Powell and Los Angeles artist Gustavo Muñiz.  

      What:   The joint exhibit will feature work by both Powell and Muñiz. Powells work is 
                autobiographical, addressing childhood memories, insecurities, inadequacies, 
                pain, depression and dreaming. Her work is dichotomous and uses symbolism 
                and bright colors to mask the sometimes disturbing truths. Her array of mediums 
                includes books, drawings, fabric blocks or even a doll. Muñizs work represents 
                imagery indicative of Mexican culture. He prints everything by hand as a means 
                of paying homage to work done with a persons own hands. He seeks to regain 
                and glorify the value and aesthetics of hand-done work.  

      When:   The exhibit runs through April 29.  

     Where:   Bronco Student Center Gallery at Cal Poly Pomona  

       Why:  Visit the Bronco Exhibit Gallery to see work by both local artists and up and 
                coming student artists.   

  Ticketing:  The exhibit is free and open to the public. Parking is $5.

                    POPULAR ACOUSTIC JAZZ QUARTET PERFORMS  
                             AT CAL POLY POMONA ON APRIL 28

(also a Cal Poly Pomona lecturer) on acoustic bass and Dean Koba on drums.  

        This popular group has been coined beguiling by The London Times, white hot by 
AllAboutJazz.com, a foursome that reflects the true heart of West Coast jazz in the 90s by LA 
Weekly and a band with considerable future potential by the Los Angeles Times.

Quartet defines contemporary acoustic jazz with its blend of sophisticated original compositions 
and a unique treatment of the classic jazz repertoire. A working ensemble since 1996, the 
Acoustic Jazz Quartet approaches the traditional quartet format from a new perspective, creating 
a unique ensemble sound.

     CAL POLY POMONA STUDENT TEAM WINS REGIONAL COMPETITION;  
                    HEADS TO NATIONAL COMPETITION MAY 22-24 
         
        The Cal Poly Pomona Students In Free Enterprise (SIFE) team returned to Pomona as 
victors after participating in the Los Angeles SIFE USA Regional Competition on April 14.    

        After presenting a report of their year-long community outreach projects to a panel of 
business leaders, the Cal Poly Pomona SIFE team was named a SIFE USA Regional Champion. 
The team will now advance to the national competition at the SIFE USA National Exposition, 
from May 22-24, in Kansas City, Mo.  

        During this academic year, the Cal Poly Pomona SIFE team developed 18 projects to 
meet definable needs within the Pomona community. For example, College Preparation Hour 
focused on high school seniors. SIFE created a two-sided, one-page laminated quick study guide 
for the youths. The front side of the page provided information on the benefits of going to 
college, financial aid and additional resources the students may need. Side two included tips on 
simple banking, starting a savings account and other financial resources available to high school 
students.  

        Giving students the confidence to succeed by making them believe in themselves really 
makes a difference in our community, said Kim Chhuor, the project leader.  

        SIFE is an international non-profit organization that mobilizes university students to 
create economic opportunity for others while discovering their own potential. It is active on over 
1,800 university campuses in more than 40 countries.   

        SIFE teams create economic opportunities in their communities by organizing outreach 
projects that teach: market economics, entrepreneurship, personal financial success skills and 
business ethics. Their projects are judged at competition on creativity, innovation and 
effectiveness.

                  OFF-BROADWAY HIT FUDDY MEERS STAGED BY  
                         CAL POLY POMONA THEATRE MAY 13-22 
 
        Cal Poly Pomonas Theatre Department will perform Fuddy Meersthe off-Broadway 
hit that received rave reviews among such publications as Daily Variety and New York 
Magazinefrom May 13-22 at the University Theatre. 

              The outrageous comedy was penned by award-winning playwright David Lindsay-
Abaire. The farce centers around a housewife, desperate to piece her life together after having 
her memory erased nightly. Every morning she awakens to her loony husband Richard and her 
17-year-old druggie eighth grade son Kenny. That all changes one day when she is approached 
by Limping Man, her lisping ski-masked kidnapper. Among the outlandish characters she faces 
are Millet, an ex-janitor with a penchant for his foul-mouthed sock puppet, and suspicious cop 
Heidi. 

        Fuddy Meers is an extraordinary play  an extremely funny comedy about a 
dysfunctional family, yet on a much deeper level it is a deft examination of domestic abuse, the 
importance of memory and the re-integration of self in a fractured society.  I wanted to direct this 
play because of the challenge of balancing farce, genuine purity of emotion, along with the 
cruelty we are all capable of, all the while never sacrificing one for the others, says director 
Bernardo Solano, a Cal Poly Pomona professor and award-winning playwright. 

              Tickets are $10-15. For more information, call the Theatre Box Office at (909) 869-3800.

of combatants be understood in an age of terrorism? What facts justify a nation going to war? 
How have weapons of mass destruction altered our understanding of self-defense as a 
justification for war? Should humanitarian intervention be permitted as an exception to the rule 
against aggressive acts? Was the recent war in Iraq justifiable on humanitarian grounds? What 
protections should prisoners of war enjoy? Could terrorism itself ever be morally justified? What 
are the responsibilities of observers or journalists embedded with a fighting force? 

        The May 5 meeting includes three sessions beginning at 9:30 a.m. On May 6, the 
conference will cover two sessions and a round table discussion beginning at 9:30 a.m.  

        All sessions are free and open to the public. For more information, call the Institute of 
Ethics and Public Policy in the Philosophy Department at (909) 869-4766.

              CAL POLY POMONA STUDENTS WIN FIRST AND SECOND PLACE  
                       IN CSU STUDENT RESEARCH COMPETITION 
         
        Cal Poly Pomona students took home three awards at the CSU Student Research 
Competition April 29-30 at Sacramento State University. More than 160 undergraduate and 
graduate students representing all 23 CSU campuses participated in the 19      th
                                                                                 annual systemwide 
research competition. 

        A total of eight presentations were made by Cal Poly Pomona students. Animal Science 
senior Andrea McCracken earned first place in the Biological & Agricultural Sciences category 
for her presentation on "The Effects of Buscopan and Xylazine on Esophageal Pressure in the 
Horse." Celia Tang, a Materials Engineering junior, received first place in the Engineering & 
Computer Science category for her presentation on "Shrinkage Control of Silica Aerogel Using 
Carbon Dioxide as Supercritical Drying Medium." 

        Electrical Engineering graduate students Walter Au and Kenny Loo tied for second place 
in the Engineering & Computer Science category (graduate division), for their joint presentation 
on "Simulation Study of Wideband Interference Rejection Using Adaptive Array Antenna." 

        The competition, which is one of the largest student achievement events of its kind in the 
CSU system, gives students the chance to perform research relevant to their field of study.  

        Given a 10-minute time limit to present orally and three minutes for questions and 
answers, students were judged on the clarity, organization, appropriateness and value of their 
research. Winners of the competition were awarded cash prizes and systemwide recognition.

    CAL POLY POMONA PROFESSORS FEATURED ON DISCOVERY CHANNEL 
                 SHOW ALIEN PLANET, AIRING SATURDAY, MAY 14 
 
        What happens when we find life outside our own planet? Two Cal Poly Pomona 
professors will help answer that question on the new Discovery Channel show Alien Planet, 
premiering on Saturday, May 14, at 8 p.m. (ET/PT). 

        In the show, viewers will embark on a mission into the future to Darwin IV, a planet 6.5 
light years from Earth with two suns and 60 percent gravity. Through computer generated 
imagery, animation and special effects, the planet reveals unexpected and startling life forms. 
Three probes each with the artificial intelligence of a 4-year-old child explore the planet, 
uncovering life forms, processing data and sending it back to scientists on Earth.  

        Alien Planet also provides in-depth scientific commentary to explain how life could 
exist in other worlds. The special features on-camera interviews with two Cal Poly Pomona 
biology professors, Curtis Clark and David Moriarty. Clark specializes in botany and is primarily 
interested in the diversity, evolution and habitat of plants. Moriarty specializes in structural 
aspects of community ecology and ornithology. 

        We haven't seen the final cut, and I am interested to see how it turns out, said Clark. 
The basic idea of another instance of life has got to be interesting to any biologist. We can be 
almost sure that when we find it, the critters of Darwin IV will seem normal by comparison, 
because they were all conceived in the imagination of humans. In the early days of consulting for 
the show, we went back and forth about the plausibility of some of the creatures that the artist 
drew, and in some ways the show could be subtitled The shifting boundary between fantasy and 
science. 

        The professors were brought onto the show through the involvement of Joan Horvath, 
CEO of Takeoff Technologies, which is based at Cal Poly Pomonas Center for Training,

Technology & Incubation. Among Takeoff Technologies functions is finding science 
consultants for entertainment companies. In addition to finding experts for the show, Horvath 
was interviewed for Alien Planet due to her role as executive director for the Global Space 
League, a nonprofit group that encourages science experimentation and interest among 
kindergarteners to college students. 
       It was a huge project, and we played a role in a large part of the show, said Horvath. 
Its important for the general public to get accurate science. 
       Other experts include Michio Kaku (string theorist, City University of New York), Jack 
Horner (paleontologist, Montana State University), Stephen W. Hawking (physicist, author, A 
Brief History of Time), and George Lucas (creator of Star Wars).  
       While professors Clark and Moriarty are used to educational lectures, and discussing 
complex topics with easy to understand terms, the experience of filming was a new one. 
       Although I talk to people every day in my classes, talking in front of the camera and 
with the green screen was quite unique, said Moriarty. We had to pretend we were looking at 
animals that weren't really there. Theyd tell us to look at an object on the ceiling (like a vent), 
and talk to that. The crew was very nice and easy to work with. 
       These experts and many more mission scientists, biologists, physicists and astrobiologists 
were consulted on topics as varied as spaceships, planetary atmosphere and life forms to provide 
the scientific underpinnings of the specials.  
       Both Clark and Moriarty will be watching Alien Planet from their homes on Saturday, 
May 14, at 8 p.m. (PT) on the Discovery Channel.

mathematics and engineering education at all levels.  Each award includes a $10,000 grant for 
continued mentoring work. 

       Burke teaches chemistry and has directly mentored a number of Hispanic, African 
American and Native American students.  In addition, she serves as director of the SEES 
program, which promotes diversity among students in the College of Science. She involves her 
students in peer mentoring groups, campus organizations, professional societies and community 
service to develop leadership skills and self-esteem.  

       Many science and math students at Cal Poly Pomona know first-hand how hard Dr. 
Burke works to help them succeed, said College of Science Dean Donald Straney. Im pleased 
she is receiving the recognition she deserves for her efforts. Whether it is working with 
individual students or developing programs to help them prepare for scientific careers, Dr. Burke 
is remarkably effective in helping students succeed.  It is because of the dedication of faculty like 
Dr. Burke that Cal Poly Pomona science and math students graduate so well prepared for their 
careers.  

       Burke has been a member of the campus community since 1983. She received a bachelor

       I am very proud to have received this award  I feel that this award is really to all of us 
who are a part of the SEES community: students, faculty, staff and parents, said Burke. I am 
happy to have been a small part of their success as they move through the university and into the 
science, technology, engineering and mathematics work force and become role models. My 
greatest joy is celebrating their successes. 
       Burke added that SEES data supports the notion that student academic success is directly 
related to effective mentoring activities. Mentoring activities extend beyond personal one-on-one 
interactions, including: peer mentoring; community building and involvement; personal 
connections between students and other faculty; and obtaining grants to provide opportunities for 
professional development, financial assistance and research. 
       Since its inception in 1996, the PAESMEM program has recognized 87 individuals and 
67 institutions.  Each year's awardees add to a widening network of outstanding mentors in the 
United States, assuring that tomorrow's scientists and engineers will better represent the nation's 
diverse population.  This year, nine individuals and five institutions received the award.  
       The 2004 individual awardees are drawn from institutions across the country and 
represent a variety of professional fields.  All are highly regarded mentors and have pioneered 
innovative and resourceful programs to broaden opportunities in science, math and engineering 
for underrepresented students at all levels. In addition to Burke, the following educators were 
recognized: 
       o  Dr. Lenore Blum, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

        CAL POLY POMONA MUSIC DEPARTMENT PRESENTS MASTER CLASS BY 
                        ALUMNA, OPERA SINGER CAROL VANESS 

 
        Music Alumna and operatic soprano Carol Vaness will present a master class on 
Wednesday, June 8, at 3:30 p.m. in the Music Recital Hall. The event is free, but there is limited 
seating so reservations are recommended. To reserve a space, call (909) 869-3554 or visit 
http://www.class.csupomona.edu/mu/emailticketrequest.html. 

        American soprano Vaness's illustrious career has encompassed regular appearances at all 
the world's major opera houses, collaborations with today's foremost conductors in operatic and 
symphonic repertoire, a distinguished catalogue of recordings, and frequent television broadcasts 
in Europe and North America. Her interpretations of Mozart's dramatic heroines have been 
hailed as definitive, and the scope and range of her voice and dramatic prowess have allowed her 
to command a repertoire of exceptional breadth and versatility. 

        Having sung dozens of roles since her 1984 debut with the Metropolitan Opera, the 
Upland-based singer is perhaps best known for her signature role as Floria Tosca, the lead 
character in Puccinis opera "Tosca," which she has performed all over the world.  

        Vaness earned a bachelors degree in music from Cal Poly Pomona in 1974. 

        Booked through 2008 in several major roles for a number of top-tier opera companies, 
Vaness will be performing the major role of the Marschallin of Werdenberg in Richard Strauss' 
"Der Rosenkavalier" this summer in Seattle. 

        Vaness also makes time to teach children the fine art of opera performance.

       "Singers careers are getting shorter and shorter these days, and I'm trying to elongate the 
careers of these kids by getting them started now," she says, adding that its important for them 
to learn from someone who's in the thick of daily performances. "The business has changed, and 
theres a lot of MTV stuff going on, but there are a lot of things that young singers can benefit 
from through the study of opera." 

       Recently, a group of alumni and students met with Vaness for an exclusive pre-opera 
backstage tour before her performance as the lead in "Vanessa" at the San Diego Opera. The 
meeting was part of the Cal Poly Pomona Alumni Association's "A Night at the San Diego

         BUS STOP JOURNALS AN ORIGINAL CAL POLY POMONA PLAY  
             CREATED WITH A FULBRIGHT GRANT STAGED JUNE 18-19 
 
       The community is invited to watch Bus Stop Journals: From Pomona to Zimbabwe, on 
June 18 and 19, at the Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center. The play is the result of a year-long 
collaboration between the universitys theater department and the University of Zimbabwe (UZ).  
       Cal Poly Pomonas Bill Morse and Bernardo Solano received a $21,800 Fulbright grant 
in support of an ongoing theater exchange program with UZ. Their research for the project has 
allowed them to explore the perceptions, or more commonly the misperceptions, each nations 
citizens may have of the other. 
       The grant funds two productions: one in Pomona with a Zimbabwean character who finds 
himself at a city bus depot and another play in Zimbabwe featuring a Cal Poly Pomona exchange 
student fresh off the bus in Harare. 
       Solano, an award-winning playwright and theater arts professor, wrote the Pomona play, 
and Morse, theater department chair and professor of design, will create the sets in both 
countries. Together, they conducted research by visiting the Foothill Transit bus terminus. 
       Our partners in Zimbabwe came up with questions that they would ask if they were 
stuck at a bus terminal in California, says Morse. The questions included, Where can I get a 
job? Wheres the nearest church? and Will Oprah Winfrey help me? 
       By interviewing the people who came off the bus, we heard some fascinating stories that 
have given us a lot of food to develop this play, says Morse. One young mother who lives with 
her parents rides as a tourist. The only way she is able to see the world and spend some time 
alone is to get on the bus and take a trip down to L.A. 
       An older woman he interviewed was an informal bus-bound missionary, and if the 
opportunity came up, shed talk about the church, he says. 
       Solano and Morse met with members of Cal Poly Pomonas African American Student 
Center to gather questions an American exchange student would ask, and they forwarded them to 
                                            more

Cal Poly Pomona  Original Play Bus Stop Journals Staged June 18-19 
Page 2 of 2 

Owen Seda, theater department chair from the University of Zimbabwe. 
       They had some good questions, but they were also concerned about wild animals, says 
Morse, which may seem strange to the folks who live in metropolitan Harare, but answering 
these questions is part of this stage-based exchange, he assured. 
       Both Cal Poly Pomona and the University of Zimbabwe have classes that explore 
community-based theater. This exchange component between the universities includes classes on 
both continents working together via the Internet as well as travel between the two. Seda will 
return to Pomona and direct the 45minute Bus Stop Journals, the second production hes 
directed for the university. Nehemiah Chivandikwa, a theater lecturer at UZ, will star as the 
Zimbabwean whos found himself lost in America. Currently Seda is writing the Harare version 
of the play, which will star Cal Poly Pomona theater major Courtney Rowan as an African 
American exchange student whos just arrived at her destination. 
       On the surface, ours sounds like a play about a Zimbabwean stuck at a bus stop, says 
Solano. But its actually about the people of Pomona, the community that rides the bus and their 
perceptions about themselves, their community and the world beyond. 
       The duos Bus Stop Journals research was so fruitful that theyve also asked some of 
the actual bus passengers they met to audition for parts in the Pomona play. And the riders are 
interested. 
       Thats part of the concept of community-based theater, says Solano. Theres a catch 
phrase for it: by, with and for. Theater that is by, with and for the community. 
       For an actor, involving people from the community is great because we say that we are 
trying to reach out through art, and in this case, were not only reaching out, but were also 
collaborating, says Rowan, who will have roles in both productions. 
       With this approach, says Morse, the success of the production is enhanced by ordinary, 
non-actors who will invite their friends and families to see the play  introducing perhaps a new 
audience to the opportunities in local theater. 
       INFORMATION: Performances will be on June 18, at 7 p.m. and 9 p.m., and June 19 at

Monterey Bay where he oversees university development, the alumni association, marketing & 
publications, special events office, public information office and government relations.  

        Under his leadership, University Advancement raised $8 million for the Chapman 
Science-Academic Center, brought in $4 million to name the new library and secured a gift of

          CAL POLY POMONA GRADUATE STUDENT WINS PRESTIGIOUS  
                   $13,000 SWITZER ENVIRONMENTAL FELLOWSHIP  
 
        Tori Kjer, a Cal Poly Pomona graduate student, was recently awarded a Switzer 
Environmental Fellowship, a highly competitive award that provides a one-year $13,000 cash 
award for graduate study as well as networking and leadership support. Only the most active, 
committed and focused individuals successfully join the network of more than 300 fellows 
selected since 1986. 

         A Los Angeles resident, Kjer is pursuing a masters in landscape architecture at Cal Poly 
Pomona.  

        I am very excited and honored to be awarded the Switzer Fellowship, said Kjer. This 
fellowship is an excellent opportunity to meet and connect with others interested in 
environmental change. 

        In addition, the fellowship will assist her in covering living expenses and other costs 
associated with conducting research and writing her thesis.   

        Kjers interests are based in environmental justice, identifying approaches to integrating 
natural systems into built infrastructure through the use of topography, swales and selective 
plantings of climate-appropriate plants, and the integration of policy and design. Her research is 
focused on issues related to community-based design in border communities and temporary 
settlements. The landscapes she will prioritize include the Colonias along the Mexico-United 
States Border, remote communities near toxic sites in the desert, rural communities lacking basic 
infrastructure, and inner-city areas surrounded by freeways, crime, and pollution.  

        Prior to graduate school, Kjer worked in a variety of positions related to social and 
environmental justice including work with homeless families, in domestic violence shelters and

community gardens. Most recently she worked as a program coordinator at the Community Food 
Security Coalition. Her role in this position was to develop and implement a program throughout 
the state of California focused on collaboration with researchers, residents, and practitioners to 
conduct community-based assessments of food availability, hunger, and nutrition.  

       Kjers post-graduate career objectives are devoted to working in impacted communities 
to implement environmental change on both a program and policy level. She hopes to integrate 
community organizing, environment and education to build stewardship, healthy neighborhoods, 
and connection to place.  

       The goal of the Switzer Environmental Fellowship Program is to support highly talented 
graduate students in New England and California whose studies are directed toward improving 
environmental quality and who demonstrate leadership in their field. Awards have been made to 
students pursuing environmental policy studies, economics, engineering, public health, and law 
as well as the more traditional sciences: biology, chemistry and physics. Technical knowledge, 
analytical skills and environmental experience are important components of a successful 
application, regardless of field of study.  

       The Switzer Environmental Fellowship Program specifically seeks active, enthusiastic 
individuals who have the ability, determination and integrity to become environmental leaders in 
the 21st century. The career and professional goals of potential fellows are carefully evaluated. 
Candidates with a strong vision of how they will apply their academic training to a career in the 
non-profit, government or private sector are preferred. Candidates pursuing academic careers, 
while not discouraged, are required to demonstrate their commitment to applied environmental 
problem solving beyond the classroom or university setting.

                 MAD COW DISEASE AND ITS HUMAN TRANSMISSION  
              ADDRESSED AT CAL POLY POMONA SEMINAR AUG. 20-21  
 
        The public is invited to attend a seminar on the discovery, detection and prevention of 
Mad Cow Disease and its rare but fatal human variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. The two-day 
symposium on the public health threat of the diseases via blood or blood products is scheduled 
Aug. 20-21 at Cal Poly Pomonas Kellogg West Conference Center and Lodge.  
        This topic is of special interest to symposium organizer Michele Rash, an assistant 
professor in Cal Poly Pomonas animal health science program. Her 14-year-old grandson 
suffers from severe hemophilia, and regularly uses blood products to survive. He received a 
contaminated batch of blood from a donor who died of a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
Disease, which has an incubation period of up to 25 years.  
        This is a topic of grave concern for the hemophilia community, but its also a hot topic 
in health and medicine, said Rash. 
        The keynote address on the history of mad cow diseases transmissibility will be given by 
Dr. Stephen Morse, director of the Center for Public Health Preparedness at the Mailman School 
of Public Health at Columbia University.  
        Speakers during the symposium include educators from USC and Colorado State 
University who specialize in mad cow disease (clinically known as Bovine Spongiform 
Encephalopathy) and the chief medical officer of the American Red Cross. 
        The conference is $250, which includes breakfast and lunch. Tickets to attend the 
keynote address and dinner are $50 each.

        Cal Poly Pomona is notifying 31,077 individuals that personal data may have been 
illegally accessed by computer hackers.  The hackers attacked servers affiliated with the Division 
of Student Affairs and the Division of Administrative Affairs.  The main student database was 
not impacted. 

        There is no indication that the hackers accessed personal data or will use it for any 
unlawful purpose. However, the university is alerting those impacted by e-mail or regular mail 
beginning today, Aug. 4.  

        The servers contained personal information, including names and Social Security 
numbers, of student applicants as well as current and former faculty, staff, and students. The 
students impacted applied and/or were enrolled in the last five years.  Based on the findings, 
there is no way to tell if the data was taken or if a person gained access to the data.  There is also 
no sign at this time that the crime took place on campus or involved faculty, staff or students.  

        Cal Poly Pomona has established a Web site, http://www.csupomona.edu/notices/security, 
and a toll-free number to answer questions and provide information to those impacted. The Web 
site also contains information on combating identity theft. 

        The university discovered evidence of hacking during routine monitoring of the network 
on June 29.  A team of university experts was immediately assembled to assess the breach, 
ascertain whether personal data had been exposed, and determine the impact on the university 
community.  That study was completed this week. Cognizant of the increased challenges of 
computer hacking and identity theft, Cal Poly Pomona continues to expand its practices to ensure 
that data held by the campus is secure.  Unauthorized computer access is a crime under section 
502 of the state penal code. It carries a penalty of up to three years in prison and fines up to 
$10,000.

                stories as seen through the eyes of the young, each delving in their own 
                contemporary and distinct style.  

      When:   The exhibit runs Sept. 10  Oct. 22, with an opening reception Sept.10, from 6

         INAUGURAL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL 
 PAIRS LOCAL PROFESSIONAL ACTORS WITH CAL POLY POMONA STUDENTS 
 
              Cal Poly Pomona is working with local professional actors to develop the inaugural 
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL in Cal Poly Pomonas Studio 
Theater (Building 25, Room 110). The festival features performances of two early 
Shakespearean plays:  romantic comedy Two Gentlemen of Verona from Sept. 8-17 and 
historical drama King John from Sept. 22-Oct. 2.  
              The brainchild of Cal Poly Pomona assistant professor Linda Bisesti and lecturer Peter 
Uribe, the Southern California Shakespeare Festival will provide the local region a chance to 
enjoy Shakespeares classic works each year, while providing collaborative opportunities and a 
creative outlet for professional actors and students from Cal Poly Pomona and local high schools.  
 Performing        Two Gentlemen of Verona will be 10 Cal Poly Pomona theater students and 
alumni. Show times are 8 p.m. Sept. 8-10 and Sept. 15-17, with a reception scheduled Sept. 10. 
       The company is trying something different with the Two Gentlemen of Verona, said 
Aaron C. Thomas, the plays director and a recent Cal Poly Pomona alumnus. This show is an 
attempt to work in a way similar to the way Shakespeare would have been performed hundreds 
of years ago: that is, without sets, lighting and an over abundance of rehearsal. 
       King John will be staged by eight professional actors (including Bisesti as Queen 
Eleanor) along with nearly a dozen students.  The show begins at 8 p.m. Sept. 22-24 and Sept. 
30-Oct. 1. The festival closes with a 2 p.m. matinee Oct. 2. The reception will be Sept. 23.  
       Shakespeare wrote about things that are so universal, theyre still just as relevant today, 
said Uribe, who will be directing the King John performance. With the things going on in the 
world today, I think people will find King John very relevant. The play asks some very 
interesting questions.  
       Tickets are $12 for general admission and $10 for students and seniors. For more 
information, call (909) 869-3900. Cal Poly Pomona is located at 3801 W. Temple Ave. in 
Pomona. Parking permits are required, and can be purchased for $5 at the Visitor Information 
booth along Kellogg Drive.

                      CAL POLY POMONA OPENS ADMISSIONS TO  
                    STUDENTS AFFECTED BY HURRICANE KATRINA  
 
        Officials at Cal Poly Pomona have opened admissions for its fall 2005 quarter to college 
students who have been displaced by Hurricane Katrina.  Cal Poly Pomona begins its fall class 
schedule Thursday, Sept. 22. 
        On Sept. 1, Charles B. Reed, Chancellor of the 23 campus California State University 
system announced that all 23 campuses will admit affected students conditionally for the fall 
2005 term.  Seven campuses  Bakersfield, Chico, Dominguez Hills, East Bay, Humboldt, Los 
Angeles and Sacramento  currently have limited space available in their fall classes. The 
remaining CSU campuses, including Cal Poly Pomona, have the option to enroll additional 
students.  Cal Poly Pomona officials have chosen to assist as many students as possible. 
        Under the Chancellor's plan, admission priority will be given to: (1) California students 
who had planned to attend colleges in the Gulf regions of Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi; 
(2) students from the hurricane-affected areas previously offered CSU admission for the fall 
2005 term; (3) former CSU students enrolled or planning to enroll for the fall 2005 term at a 
Katrina-affected college or university; (4) students who can document fall 2005 admission to or 
recent attendance at any regionally accredited college in the areas impacted by Hurricane 
Katrina.  Students admitted to Cal Poly Pomona under these guidelines will pay California 
resident fees and will receive assistance with finding on- or off-campus housing. 
        Students who have been displaced by Hurricane Katrina and who are interested in 
enrolling for classes at Cal Poly Pomona should contact Dr. George Bradshaw in Admissions & 
Outreach at (909) 869-3427 or at grbradshaw@csupomona.edu as soon as possible.  After 
admission, students will receive assistance with registration.

                            GRANT FOR LOW-INCOME CHILDREN 
 
        The Cal Poly Pomona Children's Center has received a grant award for $127,009 from 

the California Department of Education. The funds, issued for the 2005-06 academic year, will 

be used to provide 40 qualifying, low-income children ages 3-5 with free preschool services.  

        The money will also be used to subsidize the Child Care Access Means Parents in School 

(CCAMPIS) grant used for other students receiving free child care services who qualify as 

recipients of the Federal Pell Grant. 

        For 30 years, the Cal Poly Pomona Children's Center has provided low-cost quality day 

care for the children (2 years of age until entry into first grade) of students, faculty, staff and 

community members. The center's main objective is to assist student-parents in maintaining 

enrollment at Cal Poly Pomona by providing a quality child care program designed to meet the 

social, emotional and cognitive needs of young children. The Children's Center is funded by 

Associated Students Inc. and the division of Student Affairs.

                             EARNS INTERNATIONAL HONORS  
 
       A student club from Cal Poly Pomona took home four awards at the Golden Key 
International Conference in Los Angeles. The universitys chapter of the Golden Key 
International Honour Society garnered: 

       o  International Advisor of the Year Award  Dr. Andrew Thacker was the 
           chartering advisor for the Cal Poly Pomona chapter in 1984 and the former advisor 
           for the University of Houston from 1979-84. In all, he has dedicated nearly 27 years 
           of service and commitment to Golden Key, successfully developing Cal Poly Pomona 
           chapter of Golden Key into one of the largest and most recognized campus 
           organizations out of the 350 in the world. Thacker recently retired. 
                   This award is a fitting tribute to someone who has put so much effort into 
           making our chapter not only one of the most recognized organizations on campus, but 
           also one of the most successful chapters of Golden Key, said this years club 
           president Mike Johnson. 

       o  Western Region Student Leader of the Year Award  Recent computer science 
           graduate Angela Wong won the student leader award based on her dedication to 
           Golden Key as well as for campus leadership, community service and an outstanding 
           undergraduate record. She was the clubs 2004-05 vice president and previously 
           served as the groups webmaster in 2003-04.  

       o  U.S. Region Best Education-Based Service Program Award  This award 
           recognizes a chapter in each of three U.S. regions that has completed or established a 
           successful academic/education/learning oriented service program or activity.

                    CAL POLY POMONA RESEARCHERS SHOWCASE  
                     AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROJECTS OCT. 13 
  
        California is, by far, the nations leading producer and exporter of agricultural products. 
The public is invited to meet some of the faculty, staff and students who are conducting research 
to improve this thriving industry.  
        Research projects in progress at Cal Poly Pomona through the Agricultural Research 
Initiative (ARI) will be showcased on Thursday, Oct. 13, from 3-6 p.m., at the AGRIscapes 
Center (Building 211).  
        Currently, 20 ARI projects are being conducted by 13 faculty and staff and 69 students.  
Among those research projects that will be featured are:  
              *  a look at the threat of mad cow disease on public health * 
              *  development of a flu vaccine and its possible impact on the avian flu epidemic * 
              *  folate requirements and the influence of genetics  * 
        The public would likely be surprised by the scientific rigor and advanced technology 
being used by todays agricultural researchers, said Dr. David Still, Cal Poly Pomona 
coordinator of ARI. This is a great opportunity to meet our researchers and see first hand their 
research and the impact it is having in very diverse areas of agriculture.   
        To benefit the states agriculture industry and consumers, the Agricultural Research 
Initiative sponsors research in applied agricultural research.  Through a competitive grant 
program, it provides public funds that are matched by industry or federal research resources to 
support high-impact agricultural research development and technologies that are readily 
transferable to industry.   
        For more information about the showcase, contact Christy Barnecut at (909) 869-3367 or

       ULTIMATE EXPLORER HOST LISA LING TO ADDRESS LEADERSHIP  
                 DURING CAL POLY POMONA CONFERENCE OCT. 21 
  
       Host of the National Geographic series Ultimate Explorer, Lisa Ling has covered the 
looting of antiquities in war-torn Iraq, interviewed drug lords in Columbia and journeyed to the 
bottom of the Atlantic in search of gold.  
       Her next adventure is as the keynote speaker at the 3D Leadership Conference: Dream, 
Dare, Do for Cal Poly Pomona student leaders. The keynote session, which is open to the public, 
will be held Oct. 21, from 12:30 to 2 p.m. in the Bronco Student Centers Ursa Major Suite.  
       Ling became the first female host of Ultimate Explorer in December 2002. She also 
serves as a special contributor for The Oprah Winfrey Show, where she discusses her adventures. 
Prior to traveling the globe for Explorer, Ling was known for sharing her no-holds-barred 
opinions on current events and everyday issues with millions of Americans as co-host of Barbara 
Walters' hit daytime talk show The View. 
       Lings keynote address on Explore Your Leadership is part of the free 3D Leadership 
Conference, which assists students in exploring their own leadership abilities and becoming 
involved in co-curricular campus activities. The conference, designed for enrolled Cal Poly 
Pomona students, will run from 11 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and will also include lunch and breakout 
leadership training workshops.

    TRES MUNDOS EXHIBIT AT CAL POLY POMONA DOWNTOWN CENTER 
             INCLUDES RECEPTION WITH LATIN JAZZ BAND CHEVERE 
 
       The work of three master painters will be featured in the exhibit Tres Mundos: Tres 
Expreciónes, on display at the Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center from Nov. 8Dec. 17.  To 
celebrate the exhibits opening, world-known Latin Jazz band Chevere (led by band leader and 
percussionist Rudy Regalado) will perform during the opening reception at the Downtown 
Center on Saturday, Nov. 12, from 6  8 p.m.   
       Tres Mundos is a collaboration among Mexican painter Roberto Rosique, Hispanic-
American painter Gregg Stone and Chicano artist Emigdio Vasquez. The three artists provide 
snapshots of Latino life and represent the contrasting lives of Latinos in the Western World.  
Stones watercolors depict the realities of daily Mexican life, Rosiques oils represent surreal 
visions of crossing the border, and Vasquezs oils portray narratives on Chicano life in Los 
Angeles.  
       Regalado and his five-person ensemble have traveled throughout the world, performing at 
numerous summer festivals. In addition, they have created television scores for companies such 
as Dr. Pepper and the California State Lottery. They have also made appearances on television 
shows such as The Tonight Show, American Bandstand, and The Nancy Wilson Show.   
       The Chevere concert is part of the opening reception, scheduled Nov. 12, from 69 p.m. 
The concert is sponsored by the Los Angeles County Arts Commission and the Recording 
Industries Music Performance Fund through the assistance of the Processional Musicians Union 
Local 47.  
       A second reception will be Dec. 10, from 6  9 p.m. Both receptions are held in 
conjunction with the Arts Colonys Second Saturday Artwalk event with free gallery openings, 
live music, shops and restaurants all in a six-block radius. 
       The music, reception and exhibit are all open to the public and free of charge.

   "CULTURE INFUSED" ART EXHIBIT PRESENTED BY CAL POLY POMONAS 
       LA BOUNTY CHAIR OF INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLIED KNOWLEDGE                                     
        

       As Cal Poly Pomonas new Hugh O. La Bounty Chair of Interdisciplinary Applied 
Knowledge, Charlene Teters seeks to enlighten the campus and surrounding community on 
contemporary issues and challenges facing the Native American people. 

       Teters is an artist, activist and lecturer who explores and exposes racial and social 
injustices endured by Native American Indians. As her first activity as chair, Teters is co-
presenting "Culture Infused," an exhibit celebrating the work of a Native American artist, on 
display in the ASI Bronco Exhibit Gallery (Building 35) from Nov. 8-30.  

       "I want to bring an invisible community to this campus," says Teters. "Often, people 
think about Native Americans as we were envisioned at the turn of the century. If we're not 
walking around in buckskin and fringe, mimicking the stereotype in dress and art form, we're not 
seen as real. Native Americans are here, and we are contemporary people, yet we are very much 
informed and connected to our history." 

       Teters was born in Spokane, Wash., and is a Spokane tribal member. Since 1997, she has 
been a professor at the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA) in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where 
she has taught painting, drawing, and a course on contemporary issues in Native American Art. 

       As a founding board member of the National Coalition on Racism in Sports and the 
Media, Teters challenges the inappropriate use of American Indian images, culture and spiritual 
life ways by schools, scholars, museums, corporations and media. Her story of challenging 
America's use of Indians as mascots is the subject of a nationally aired award winning 
documentary "In Whose Honor?"  

       Previously, Teters served as dean and then a consultant for the Native American Youth

Outreach Program, and as interim dean at the Center for Arts and Cultural Studies at IAIA. 

       Teters earned a master's of fine art in painting from the University of Illinois and a 
bachelor's in painting from the College of Santa Fe. In 2000, she received honorary doctorate of 
fine arts from Mitchell College in New London, Conn. 

       In November 2003, Teters was nominated as one of the New Mexican's "10 Who Made a 
Difference" in The Santa Fe New Mexican Newspaper. ABC World News Tonight with Peter 
Jennings honored Teters in 1997 as "Person of the Week." 

       Teters began her appointment as La Bounty Chair in September. The chair was 
established in 1997 to bring distinguished scholars and recognized professionals from academe, 
business, industry, the arts and/or public service. As a one-year appointment with the possibility 
of renewal for one to two additional years, the chair is expected to contribute to the university's 
mission "to advance learning and knowledge by linking theory and practice in all disciplines, and 
to prepare students for lifelong learning, leadership, and careers in a changing multicultural 
world." The chair does this by establishing a teaching, scholarship/creative activity and 
community-based program in her area of expertise. 

       "Culture Infused" is co-sponsored by the Cal Poly Pomona Native American Student 
Center and Associated Students Inc. The exhibit features the thesis work of David Dalasohya Jr., 
a Hopi Indian who was born and raised in Anaheim. His art work is a personal expression of his 
urban upbringing and his close ties to Hopi relatives. Dalasohya is currently working on his 
bachelor's of fine arts at the Institute of American Indian Art in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where 
Teters previously instructed him.

 CAL POLY STUDENTS HURRY TO COMPLETE 58                        TH
                                                                  FLOAT FOR ROSE PARADE; 
   CAL POLY POMONA ARABIAN HORSES ALSO FEATURED IN JAN. 2 EVENT 
 
       With less than two weeks to go, the Cal Poly Universities Rose Float Committee and the 
W.K. Kellogg Arabian Horse Center are dashing to finish preparations for the university's 
appearance in the 2006 Pasadena Tournament of Roses Parade on Jan. 2.  The universitys fine 
Arabian horses will be 67th in the parade lineup while the parade float will be 72nd. 

       Students from Cal Poly Universities in Pomona and San Luis Obispo are quickly 
finalizing the float construction and will soon begin decorating their 58th float entry, "Enchanted 
Reverie." Campus and community volunteers are encouraged to join in the distinctly Southern 
California tradition of decorating the float between Christmas and New Year at the Brookside 
Pavilion on the corner of Seco Street and Arroyo Boulevard in Pasadena. 

        The float entry, designed to match the parade theme, "It's Magical," depicts a troupe of 
fairies and a friendly dragon. Using animation, many of the fairies will be gently moving, 
fluttering their wings and being revealed by giant flowers. One fairy will pour water from her 
vessel into a stream, and the dragon will move its head, neck, wings and tail. When completed, it 
will stand 25 feet high, 18 feet wide and 55 feet long.  

        In addition to the float, Cal Poly Pomona's purebred Arabian horses will be featured in 
this year's parade. W.K. Kellogg Arabian Horse Center Director Bill Hughes and eight students 
will ride the horses, adorned in western, English and traditional Arabian costume. (View a list of 
riders and horses at the end of this article.) In recent years, Cal Poly Pomona's Arabian horses 
also rode in the 2003, 2000 and 1997 Pasadena Tournament of Roses Parades.  

       About two dozen students from Cal Poly Pomona and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo work on 
the Rose Float year round. The two campuses, located approximately 225 miles apart, manage to 
coordinate the effort to complete the float for each parade. Throughout the 12-month period, both

student committees work closely together on the design and construction of their respective 
portion to ensure the float is built to specification. 

        Students from the two universities have designed, constructed, decorated and financed 
entries to the Tournament of Roses Parade every year since 1949. Involvement in this project 
highlights the Cal Poly Universities' learn-by-doing philosophy as students develop these 
decorative floats from design conception to welding together steel and pasting petals to driving 
the contraption down Colorado Boulevard.

LONG-STANDING ROSE PARADE FLOAT TRADITION AT CAL POLY UNIVERSITIES 
        CELEBRATES HANDS-ON LEARNING, IMAGINATION AND INGENUITY  

        Every Jan. 1, those from Cal Poly Pomona and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo celebrate the 
New Year as well as observe a long-standing tradition in the Tournament of Roses Parade. 
Students from the two universities have designed, constructed, decorated and financed entries to 
the Tournament of Roses Parade every year since 1949. Involvement in this project highlights 
the Cal Poly Universities learn-by-doing philosophy as students spend nearly a year developing 
these decorative floats from design conception to welding together steel and pasting petals to 
driving the contraption down Colorado Boulevard.  

               What is now a 58-year tradition actually came about much by accident. Don Miller, a 
student who was then attending the California Sate Polytechnic Schools Voorhis campus (a 
forerunner to Cal Poly Pomona) and majoring in ornamental horticultural, had always wanted to get 
involved in the Rose Parade. Millers father was in fact a former Tournament of Roses president. 

              In September 1948, Miller received a call from Rose Parade officials, asking if Cal Poly 
could have a float ready for the Jan. 1, 1949 parade to replace an entry that had just dropped out. 
Miller, without checking with any campus administrator or faculty member, committed the 
university to an entry. 

              At that time, the Voorhis campus was an all-male enrollment devoted to agricultural studies. 
As word of the challenge spread, the Voorhis student body pulled together to meet the deadline.  

              The first float earned the parades Award of Merit. Since then, the annual Rose Float 
project has garnered another 44 awards as well as grown in size and scope, involving both 
campus communities in Pomona and San Luis Obispo.  

        Other landmark years include the universities first use of hydraulics for animation in 
1968, the first use of computer-controlled animation in 1978, and the first use of fiber optics in 
the 1982 entry.

               CAL POLY UNIVERSITIES 2006 ROSE FLOAT ORGANIZERS 
             WELCOME VOLUNTEERS AT PASADENA DECORATION TENT                                      
 
        About two dozen students from Cal Poly Pomona and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo work on 
their Rose Float entry year round. However, to complete the float, volunteers are encouraged to 
join in the distinctly Southern California tradition of decorating the Rose Floats between 
Christmas and New Year.  

        Float decorations will take place at Brookside Pavilion in Pasadena, south of the Rose 
Bowl Stadium. Every inch of the float must be covered with natural materials, such as flowers, 
leaves, seeds or bark.  
        In all, students working on the float estimate that more than 15,000 roses, 550 bunches of 
mums and 300 bunches of carnations will be used to decorate the Cal Poly Universities 2006 
float Enchanted Reverie, which depicts a depicts a troupe of fairies who have joined together 
around their treetop castle. Hyacinth root will be used as hair for the fairies as well as pampas 
grass. In addition, lilies, liatris, gerber daisies, gladiolas, iris, solidago, asters, freesia, babys 
breath, delphinium, sunflowers, bells of Ireland and other natural materials will be used.  
        For more information, contact Janetta McDowell, senior coordinator of the Rose Float, at 
(909) 869-3642. After Dec. 23, contact Rose Float organizers in their Pasadena tent at (626) 356-
4641 and (626) 356-9205.

                   Universities entry into the Rose Parade, will make a late night excursion from 
                   the Cal Poly Pomona campus to the Brookside Tent decoration center located 
                   just south of the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. The Cal Poly Universities project  
                   involving both the Pomona and San Luis Obispo campuses  is the only Rose 
                   Parade float entry designed, constructed, decorated and financed entirely by 
                   students. 

          Who:   The 45-time award-winning Rose Float Club and Committee from the Cal 
                   Poly Universities in Pomona and San Luis Obispo 

         When:   From 10:30 p.m. on Dec. 23 until roughly 2:30 a.m. on Dec. 24  

        Where:   Begins at the Cal Poly Pomona Rose Float Lab (Building 64) and ends at the 
                   Rose Bowl Parking Lots Brookside Pavilion decoration center 

          Why:  From Dec. 23 to Jan. 1, final float preparations, decorating and judging takes 
                   place at the Brookside Tent. Because of the floats large size and obvious 
                   potential for traffic distraction, it is transported at night. 

 Opportunity:  This is a unique photo opportunity, offering a glimpse at a significant stage in 
                  preparing the Cal Poly Universities Rose Float that the public might not 
                   normally see. Reporters and photographers are welcome to observe the floats 
                   journey and the logistical work involved in such a move.

       Cal Poly Pomona is proud to boast two entries in this year's Tournament of Roses Parade 
on Jan. 2. The university's fine-bred Arabian horses will be the 67th entry in the parade lineup 
while the student-built "Enchanted Reverie" float will be 72nd. 
       Students from Cal Poly Pomona and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo have designed, 
constructed and decorated their 58th entry into the Tournament of Roses Parade. The Cal Poly 
Universities have been represented in the internationally televised parade since 1949, earning 
them the distinction of having the most consecutive entries in the parade's history. 
       The 2006 float, "Enchanted Reverie" depicts a troupe of fairies gathered around their 
treetop castle to bask in their whimsical wonderland while a friendly dragon oversees their dream 
world. Playing in the background will be "Shipmeisters' Humoresque" by Yoko Shimomura.  
       In addition to the float, Cal Poly Pomona's purebred Arabian horses will be featured in 
this year's parade. W.K. Kellogg Arabian Horse Center Director Bill Hughes and eight students 
will ride the horses, adorned in western, English and traditional Arabian costume. In recent 
years, Cal Poly Pomona's Arabian horses also rode in the 2003, 2000 and 1997 Pasadena 
Tournament of Roses Parades.

              CAL POLY POMONA GROUP ORGANIZES SILENT MARCH  
                     ON JAN. 17 TO HONOR CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS  
 
        In honor of Martin Luther King, Jr.s birthday, Cal Poly Pomonas Civil Rights Legacy 
Coalition invites the community to participate in a silent march through campus on Tuesday, Jan. 
17, at noon. The event will be followed by an address by Halford Fairchild, an activist and 
professor of psychology and black studies at Pitzer College. 

        Designed to celebrate and honor MLK and other nonviolent leaders, the silent march will 
begin at the flagpole in front of the CLA Building at 11:50 a.m. (Participants are asked to wear 
black to show solidarity.) The procession will then march to the pancakes in the southeast 
corner of the University Quad, where Fairchild will speak. 

        Fairchild was active in addressing the murder of Irvin Landrum, Jr., an 18-year-old black 
man shot to death by Claremont police officers in 1999. Following the shooting, the two officers 
involved were named Officers of the Year by the Claremont Police and City Employees of 
the Year by the city. Fairchild organized a coalition that protested and called for further 
investigation into the shooting. Ultimately, as a result of a coalition led by Fairchild, the awards 
were rescinded. 

        Cal Poly Pomonas Civil Rights Legacy Coalition is comprised of various campus 
organizations, including the Michi & Walter Weglyn Endowed Chair for Multicultural Studies, 
Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc., the African American Student Center, the Raise Your Voice 
Campaign, the Center for Community Service-Learning, Impact, the Black Student Union (BSU) 
and the Student Coalition for a Just Peace.

                         CAL POLY POMONA LIBRARY RECEIVES 
           $2.1 MILLION GRANT FROM US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 
 
        The University Library has received a $2,129,397 Title V Hispanic-Serving Institutions 
(HSI) Grant from the U.S. Department of Education, which comes as the library prepares for its 
upcoming renovation and addition. The five-year grant will be used to strengthen library-based 
learning through a multimedia library collection, improved learning technology and teaching 
information literacy. 
              "The library faces the challenges of maintaining a relevant collection for a technology-
heavy curriculum, meeting the information needs of an ethnically diverse study body, and 
improving student learning skills necessary for a successful academic experience," says 
University Library Dean Harold Schleifer. "Although we received funding as a Hispanic-Serving 
Institution, all of our students will benefit greatly from this grant." 
              Cal Poly Pomona is an officially qualified Hispanic-Serving Institution, with at least 25 
percent Hispanic undergraduate student enrollment. In Fall 2005, the university's total enrollment 
of 19,885 comprised 30.5 percent Hispanic students, according to the Institutional Research, 
Assessment & Planning department. 
              Specifically, the library plans to use this grant to: 
        •   Build a collection that supports the study of Hispanic culture as well as brings 
            Hispanic perspectives to the curriculum at Cal Poly Pomona by adding at least 5,000 
            items of books, media materials and electronic resources (databases and e-books) to 
            the library.   
        •   Outfit two computer-based research centers for students and one video conference 
            center for faculty development in the new library building addition.

       •   Implement an information literacy program through a three-tiered (freshmen, 
           junior/senior, graduate/credential) Web tutorial. The program will be a permanent 
           component of the library's instruction program.   
       •   Establish an endowment fund that provides continued support of the Hispanic studies 
           collection and maintenance of the learning facilities and the information literacy 
           program.  
              The U.S. Department of Education awards Title V Developing Hispanic-Serving 
Institutions Grants to assist eligible institutions of higher education to expand their capacity to 
serve Hispanic and low-income students. Five-year development grants and one-year planning 
grants may be awarded.  
              Grant activity has been timed to coincide with construction of the University Library 
addition and renovation, a $64 million-plus capital project funded principally by Proposition 47, 
which passed in 2002. The project will feature the addition of 101,853 gross square feet and the 
renovation of 96,831 gross square feet of people space to accommodate increasing enrollment. 
This space will include classrooms and other areas to support new technological applications of 
library research. The current six-story building will be renovated to correct significant building 
deterioration and hazardous conditions in the outdated facility. Wiring for state-of-the-art 
computing and telecommunications technology and improvements in Americans With 
Disabilities Act (ADA) access are also planned. The new library will feature an indoor/outdoor 
cafe, as well as wireless laptop computers.  
              The library is preparing for construction in Winter 2006, and the project is anticipated to 
reach completion by Spring 2008.

      CAL POLY POMONA STUDENTS WIN NATIONAL COMPUTER SECURITY VIDEO CONTEST 
                              Fourth Student Earns Honorable Mention 
 
              Three Computer Information Systems students at Cal Poly Pomona won the gold award 
in a nationwide computer security awareness video contest for their humorous educational video 
Bob, Youve Been Phished.  

        Sharing the gold award in the single security issue category are seniors Kevin Atef 
(Diamond Bar), Johnson Chau (El Monte) and Michael Wong (Arcadia). In addition, CIS 
student James Kulbacki (Alhambra) earned honorable mention for his video Password Strength 
& Security.  

        The students videos can be viewed at http://www.educause.edu/SecurityVideoContest. 

        Sponsored by EDUCAUSE/Internet2 Computer & Network Security Task Force, and the 
National Cyber Security Alliance, the computer security awareness video contest is part of a 
national campaign to raise awareness of, and increase computer security at, colleges and 
universities. 

        The prevention of computer-related security problems is a critical issue for institutions 
of higher education. Students are particularly prone to cybersecurity risks, says Rodney 
Petersen, security task force coordinator with EDUCAUSE. We believe that the videos that 
were produced as part of this contest will go a long way towards educating students about how 
to improve the security of their computers, use the Internet safely, and will enhance their overall 
academic experience.

dating, eventually leading to his personal information being stolen via a phishing attack. 
(Phishing is a form of social engineering where a person poses as a trustworthy source in an 
attempt to acquire sensitive information.) After being exploited by the attacker, Bob is informed 
of the security concerns with phishing and given suggestions on how to prevent this from 
occurring in the future.  
              We felt this video would be a great way for us to make a contribution to the CIS 
department and to inform fellow students on internet security, the students said. The whole 
process, from brainstorming to editing, was a team effort. We learned as we went, using each 
others strong points to make the video a success. Slowly it came together, piece by piece, from 
researching the song title to convincing a male student to dress up as an attractive female 
college student, skirt and all! The video is guaranteed to teach you something and make you 
laugh at the same time. 

              The contest searched for two categories of short computer awareness videos that 
addressed a broad range of security topics or focused on a single security issue. There were 62 
video submissions  developed by college students for college students  from 17 universities. 
Winners were selected for creativity, content and quality of information, overall effectiveness of 
the delivery and technical quality.  

       Cal Poly Pomonas gold winners received a $1,000 cash prize, and their video will be 
used in campus security awareness campaigns and efforts nationwide. Other winning entries 
came from Savannah College of Art and Design, College of William & Mary, University of 
Virginia, Idaho State University, Wake Forest University and James Madison University.

                     CAL POLY POMONA PROFESSOR HONORED AS FELLOW IN  
                   AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE 
 
        The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) has awarded Cal 
Poly Pomona professor Jill Adler-Moore the distinction of AAAS Fellow. Adler-Moore, who 
joined the Cal Poly Pomona biological sciences department in 1974, was elected as a fellow for 
her innovative development of liposomal formulations for the delivery of antifungal drugs. 
              The selection as an AAAS Fellow was a complete surprise to me, says Adler-Moore, 
coordinator of the universitys Biotechnology Program. I am honored and feel that truthfully 
there were many very good scientists who worked with me over these many years, helping to 
make these accomplishments possible. No one can do these kinds of things without collaborating 
with a range of talented scientific colleagues and students. The honor goes to all of these people 
as well. 
              AAAS is the worlds largest general scientific society, and publisher of the journal, 
Science. The tradition of AAAS Fellows began in 1874. Election as a fellow is an honor 
bestowed upon AAAS members by their peers.  
              This year 376 members have been awarded this honor by AAAS because of their 
scientifically or socially distinguished efforts to advance science or its applications.  

        Adler-Moore has consulted with biotechnology/pharmaceutical companies since 1984. 
Her research interests have focused on medical mycology and immunology. For the past 17 
years, she has published articles and been awarded patents in the area of liposomal drug delivery. 
Her research was supported through grants from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, U.S.

research contracts from various pharmaceutical companies including NeXstar Pharmaceuticals 
Inc., Gilead Sciences Inc., Fujisawa Healthcare Inc. and Molecular Express Inc. 
              In 1984, Adler-Moore was studying amphotericin B, a drug that effectively killed fungi  
a concern to any patient whose immune system is compromised because of disease or surgery  
but was also toxic. 

        "I had the idea that if we could design a vehicle, a fat body, to put the amphotericin B 
into, it would still retain its ability to kill fungus, but it wouldn't be toxic for the patient," she 
says.  
              During a sabbatical, Adler-Moore took the project to Vestar Inc., a small biotechnology 
company in Pasadena that specialized in making fat bodies, or liposomes. The final formulation, 
an antifungal agent called AmBisome, is administered intravenously. It was approved by the 
FDA in 1997 and Gilead Sciences Inc. now manufactures and sells the drug worldwide.  
              In addition to her research, Adler-Moore serves on several regional and statewide boards 
concerned with the development of the biotechnology industry and education throughout 
California.  
              She received a doctorate in medical microbiology from Cornell University.  

        Adler-Moore, along with the other new fellows, will be recognized for contributions to 
science at the Fellows Forum during the 2006 AAAS Annual Meeting in St. Louis, Mo., on Feb. 
18. She will be presented with an official certificate and a gold and blue (representing science 
and engineering, respectively) rosette pin.

drawing attention to the sacred relationship that exists between humans and the planet, Mother 
Earth, according to the organizers.   
              At sunrise on Feb. 11, runners and supporters of the 28th
                                                                      annual International Sacred Run 
will gather on San Franciscos Alcatraz Island for a send-off ceremony. Then the runners will 
travel to Sacramento and run cross-country to Washington D.C., a distance of about 4,000 miles.

       CAL POLY POMONA LIBRARY ADDITION AND RENOVATION CONSTRUCTION TO BEGIN 
         Groundbreaking Feb. 20 Signals Start of Construction for $58.5 Million Project 
                                                      
        After years of planning, the Cal Poly Pomona University Library addition and renovation 
project will soon begin construction.  

        The university asks for patience from the campus community and public who use the 
library during the construction process. Fences will soon be erected surrounding the University 
Library and will affect parking in Lot D. In addition, books and documents have been moved to 
the top three floors of the University Library.  

        While the next few years are going to be challenging for the community, faculty, staff 
and students, the library will remain open during construction and will maintain a functioning 
library to serve the needs of the campus community and region. Construction is expected to 
reach completion by Spring 2008, resulting in a state-of-the-art regional educational center. 

        An official groundbreaking ceremony for the University Library addition and renovation 
project will be held on Monday, Feb. 20, at 11 a.m. on the northeast side of the library, next to 
parking lots C and D. The event is open to the public. 

        Campus leaders and those involved in the project will commemorate the groundbreaking 
and provide a preview of the new facility. Renderings of the renovation and historic information 
about the library will be available.  

        The library addition and renovation is a $58.5 million-plus capital project lead by Carrier 
Johnson Architects and Rudolph & Sletten Construction Management Co. The addition is funded 
principally by Propositions 47 and 55, which passed in 2002 and 2004. However, additional 
funds must be raised to complete renovation of the upper floors of the building.

       The current library project also consists of two phases. Phase I will feature the addition of 
101,853 gross square feet of people space to accommodate increasing enrollment. This 
space, which will come from the enclosure of the ground floor overhang and expansion of the 
buildings east and west sides, will include classrooms and other areas to support new 
technological applications of library research. This phase will also feature the interior renovation 
of the first three floors of the six-story building, including wiring for state-of-the-art computing 
and telecommunications technology and improvements in Americans with Disabilities Act 
(ADA) access. The new library will feature a full-service Starbucks with indoor and outdoor 
seating, as well as wireless laptop computers. 

       Another aspect of the project will be to reorient the building to better position itself along 
the universitys cultural spine, lining the library up with the W. Keith & Janet Kellogg 
University Art Gallery, Music Building and University Theatre, said Library Dean Harold 
Schleifer. The librarys main entrance will be moved to the ground floor facing the University 
Park, with an atrium in the first floor that will create an area for people to walk through the 
library as opposed to around it. 

       Phase II will include renovation of the upper three floors and replacement of the existing 
exterior concrete panels, updating the overall environment and use of existing space. It will 
correct significant building deterioration in the outdated facility, including the heating, air 
conditioning and plumbing systems.  

       The ground, first and second floors will be closed during construction, and, as a result, 
the library has compressed its services, staff, study space and collections into the existing third, 
fourth and fifth floors of the library. To accommodate the smaller space, some of the library's 
volumes have been sent to storage. Library subject specialists are available to address the impact 
on collections.  

       Housing a collection exceeding 3 million items, the University Library was originally 
constructed in two phases. The four lower floors were finished in 1968, and the upper two floors 
were completed in 1989 to create a combined 205,000 square feet of floor space.

                                                                        University Theatre

play follows Anna Frieling, nicknamed Mother Courage.                    
Bretchts best-known drama trails Mother Courage across                 War drama follows a woman who 
                                                                        struggles to maintain her livelihood

livelihood. Along the way she is forced to sell provisions              1648. Directed by professor 
                                                                        Bernardo Solano.

        The content of the play is geared toward a mature 
audience.  Bertolt structured the play to focus the audience on the war rather than the characters 
and emotions.  

        Bertolt Brecht wrote the play during the eve of World War II, but it is no less relevant 
today as it was then, especially in light of our country's occupation in Iraq, said Bernardo 
Solano, the plays director and a Cal Poly Pomona professor. This play is one of the 20th 
century's greatest plays, an epic statement against war and the people who profit from it.  

        Solano added the production will be a unique event in the cultural and political life of 
this campus because it will feature original music composed by music department alumni 
Jonathon Guillen and Katherine Clever. 

        Mother Courage and Her Children will be staged at 8 p.m. on Feb. 24-25 and March 2-4.

        CAL POLY POMONA AND U.S. AIR FORCE COLLABORATE ON NEW WIND TUNNELS 
 
       The Cal Poly Pomona College of Engineering is partnering with the United States Air 
Force to build two wind tunnels. In about two years, the supersonic and subsonic wind tunnels, 
which are used to simulate airflow for aerodynamic testing, will enhance the ability of Aerospace 
Engineering students to conduct experiments and research in aerodynamics. 

       This new equipment will better prepare our graduates to meet the technical challenges 
and opportunities of aerospace engineering in the 21  st
                                                        century, says College of Engineering 
Dean Edward Hohmann. 

       Congresswoman Grace F. Napolitano (D-38       th
                                                       District, California) recently gave President 
Michael Ortiz a $1 million check representing a grant to fund the acquisition of a supersonic 
wind tunnel. The check presentation took place Jan. 25 before the senior-level Aerospace Design 
class in the Aerospace Engineering Supersonic Wind Tunnel Laboratory in Building 13. 
Napolitano, who represents the university in her congressional district, was instrumental in 
helping to obtain the funding. 

       Im very proud of Cal Poly Pomona because the university is providing the opportunity 
for young people to learn and educate themselves in areas where there will definitely be a 
demand for jobs, said Napolitano.  

       Among those who participated in the check presentation were Hohmann and Ali Ahmadi, 
chair of Aerospace Engineering. 

       The primary purpose of this grant is to replace Cal Poly Pomonas existing supersonic 
wind tunnel, which has been a workhorse for the Aerospace Engineering department for the past 
42 years and is now in need of major repairs. While similar in overall size (35 feet), the new 
wind tunnel will have an expanded test section, allowing larger models to be tested. The wind

tunnel will be capable of simulating an aircraft flying up to four times the speed of sound. It will 
be located in the existing Supersonic Wind Tunnel Laboratory in Building 13 and will become 
operational in Fall 2007. 

       Last year, the College of Engineering received a similar grant from the Air Force for the 
acquisition of a subsonic wind tunnel, which will replace an aging one that had to be dismantled 
when the Engineering Laboratory Building 17 was constructed. The new subsonic wind tunnel, 
though somewhat smaller than the one it replaces (approximately 53 x 22 in overall size, with a 
test section of 28 x 40), will include modern instruments and improved flow quality. It will 
simulate speeds up to 190 miles per hour. The subsonic wind tunnel will be located along the 
south side of Building 13 and will become operational in Fall 2006. 

       Both new wind tunnels will allow students to test scale models of aircraft and rockets, as 
well as other vehicles, moving at speeds above or below the speed of sound. 

       The wind tunnels are part of the Education Partnership Agreement between Cal Poly 
Pomona and the Air Force signed in 2004. The equipment will be on long-term loan to the 
university for educational and research purposes by Cal Poly Pomona students and faculty, as 
well as, in collaboration with the Air Force, aerospace industry and other universities of their 
choosing. In addition, the wind tunnels will be available for tours to K-12 students to promote 
interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. 

       Cal Poly Pomona has long provided well-trained aerospace engineers to meet the needs 
of the aerospace industry and government laboratories. Since its founding in the fall of 1957, the 
Aerospace Engineering department has awarded more than 1,300 bachelors and masters 
degrees. Demand for the Aerospace Engineering program has been on the rise, with enrollment 
more than doubling over the last nine years to about 400 students.

        Cal Poly Pomona President J. Michael Ortiz has been named to the bi-partisan 
independent Commission on No Child Left Behind. Congress is scheduled to begin 
reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act in 2007, and over the next 12 to 18 months the 
commission will conduct a high level, independent and bipartisan analysis of No Child Left 
Behind.  
        I am honored to be selected for this important commission and look forward to the 
challenges ahead, said Dr. Ortiz. We are going to review this program in the most appropriate 
and efficient way, by analyzing data so as to provide Congress with the best possible 
recommendations. 
        The Commission on No Child Left Left Behind is co-chaired by former Health and 
Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson and former Georgia Governor Roy E. Barnes. 
The commission represents a vast cross section of Americas key education stakeholders.  
Commission members include: 
    •   Dr. Craig Barrett, chairman of the board, Intel Corporation  
    •   Dr. Christopher Edley, Jr, dean, University of California, Berkeley School of Law

develop the No Child Left Behind Act.  It is time for us to join together once again to ensure that 
our Nation continues to close the achievement gap, said Thompson. 
       The commission will use several means to gather information and public input for its 
recommendations. This includes hosting five national hearings focusing on teachers, 
assessments, accountability, and sanctions and incentives. Another key element in the 
commission's efforts will be its Web site: www.nclbcommission.org, which includes background 
information on the No Child Left Behind Act, updates on Commission activities, and state-by-
state academic achievement data. The Web site allows users to submit their concerns, ideas and 
thoughts about NCLB directly to the commission.  Lastly, the commission staff will issue a 
series of white papers that highlight key NCLB policy issues.  These papers will be available on 
the Commission Web site.   
       Housed at the Aspen Institute, the commission is funded by some of the top education 
foundations in the nation, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Ewing Marion 
Kauffman Foundation, the Joyce Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation, Carnegie Corporation of New York, and the Spencer Foundation.

CAL POLY POMONA, CSU AND PIQE WORK TO STRENGTHEN PARENT INVOLVEMENT IN EDUCATION  
                  Organizations to Develop Parent Programs at 15 Local Schools 
                                                      
        Cal Poly Pomona is working with the Parent Institute for Quality Education (PIQE) and 

the California State University to improve the college admission rate of underserved students 

through a three-year parent involvement program at 15 local schools. 

        The CSU partnership with PIQE is significant because it adds to many other efforts to 

help improve the public school system, said CSU Chancellor Charles B. Reed.  Improving the 

states public K-12 schools is critical to the future of California and quality of the Cal State 

system, since we expect that many of those students ultimately enroll at a CSU campus. 

        PIQE provides a nine-week parent involvement program that teaches parents of preschool 

through high school students how to navigate the school system, assess their childrens academic 

progress, and understand requirements for admission to a four-year university. Since 1987, PIQE 

has graduated more than 350,000 parents in California from 15 language groups. 

        Without question, empowered parents impact student success, said Cal Poly Pomona 

President Michael Ortiz. Higher education can play an important role with parents and the K-12 

community, by helping to prepare and assimilate those students for life in college and beyond. 

        CSU Chancellor Reed has pledged $75,000 to PIQE over a three-year period to serve 15

schools in the Cal Poly Pomona campus service area.  PIQE will match his pledge and leveraged 

private contributions to meet the program cost.  The host schools will cover a portion of the 

program costs.  The project agreement provides that each child of a PIQE graduate will receive a 

college ID that reserves them a space at the university if they meet the minimum admission 

requirements when they graduate from high school.   

       David Valladolid, president and chief executive officer of PIQE, said PIQE is 

committed to expand its outreach to parents throughout California. The special offer by CSU of a 

college identification card for all the children of PIQE graduates will greatly enhance the success 

of our recruitment of parents.  It will send families the profound message that a spot awaits their 

children in college if they study hard and meet the admission requirements.

      REGIONAL MATHCOUNTS COMPETITION HELD AT CAL POLY POMONA FEB.25 
 
       Local teams of sixth through eighth grade student mathletes competed in a regional 
Mathcounts competition on Feb. 25 at Cal Poly Pomonas Bronco Student Center.  
       The local contest was sponsored by Cal Poly Pomona, the Foothill Section of the Institute 
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the California Society of Professional Engineers. Cal 
Poly Pomona often works with community partners to encourage K-12 students to pursue 
knowledge at a young age.  
       The days events began with individual competitions consisting of the sprint and target 
rounds. The morning session wrapped up with a team round where groups of four students 
representing local middle and junior high schools competed amongst each other. The top 12 
individuals then competed in head-to-head countdown round in the afternoon. 
       Suzanne Middle School of Walnut placed first in the team competition, followed by 
Alvarado Middle School of Rowland Heights. The top student in the competition was Richmond 
Wong of Rincon Intermediate School in West Covina. Terry Xu of Suzanne Middle School was 
second, followed by Maggie Su from Glendoras Goddard Middle School. 
       Regional winners earn a spot in the California State competition to be held 
simultaneously at UC Davis and UC Irvine on Saturday, March 18. The competition will 
culminate with a national competition to be held May 11-14 in Arlington, Virginia.  
       Founded by the National Society of Professional Engineers in 1983, Mathcounts is a 
nationwide program to boost the math competency of middle school students in our public 
school system. The program features a series of competitions with elimination rounds based on 
team and individual effort.  
       The San Gabriel Valley competition was initiated at Cal Poly Pomona in the 1980s. After 
rotating at various middle schools the competition returned to Cal Poly Pomona three years ago 
with Cal Poly Pomona students helping to conduct the contest and Dr. Ioana Mihaila of the 
universitys Math department serving as Contest Chair.

                     CAL POLY POMONA STUDENTS TO SPEND SPRING BREAK  
      TEACHING SECOND-GRADERS IN IXTLAN DEL RIO, MEXICO ABOUT GLOBAL MARKETS 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  During Spring Break, seven members of Cal Poly Pomonas 
Students in Free Enterprise (SIFE) club will travel to Ixtlan del Rio in Mexico to teach second-
grade students at six schools about global markets, from March 22-26.  
        Ixtlan del Rio is in the state of Nayarit in Mexico. SIFE students will work with hundreds 
of students as well as meet with the towns mayor and other officials.  
        To help the Mexican youths understand global markets, the SIFE team members will 
distribute about 400 bilingual coloring books they developed. The book tells the story of a farmer 
who grows corn to sell in both local and global markets.  
        We feel it is important to help children understand the dynamics around them. The free 
and global markets of today are making the world of tomorrow even smaller. If students are able 
to realize and understand these concepts at a younger age, they will in time be better prepared for 
higher education, the workplace, and the rest of their lives, said Judith Meza, an international 
business major and project leader. 
        After their return from Ixtlan del Rio, SIFE students will also distribute their bilingual 
coloring books in the Inland Valley and San Gabriel Valley communities. 
        SIFE is an international non-profit organization that mobilizes university students to 
create economic opportunity for others while discovering their own potential. It is active on over 
1,800 university campuses in more than 40 countries.   
        The Cal Poly Pomona SIFE students are working in partnership with the SIFE group at 
the Los Angeles Trade and Technical College, which will send an additional four students.   
        The Cal Poly Pomona SIFE chapter is highly active. After presenting a report of their 
year-long community outreach projects to a panel of business leaders last year, the Cal Poly 
Pomona SIFE team was named a 2005 SIFE USA Regional Champion.

                     CAL POLY POMONA STUDENTS OFFER FREE TAX ASSISTANCE  
                                      FOR LOW-INCOME TAXPAYERS 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Cal Poly Pomona students will provide free tax clinics from 10 a.m. 
to 4 p.m. on Saturdays through April 15 at the Boys and Girls Club in Pomona, 1420 N. Garey 
Ave. in Pomona. Those interested in participating in a free tax clinic should call (909) 980-2857 
ext. 288 for details. 

        This volunteer program is one of the ways the Cal Poly Pomona community works for 
California. Students must study and pass a test to qualify to participate in the volunteer income 
tax assistance program. The free income tax preparation program is offered as part of a course 
(ACC 434 Service Learning in Taxation) taught by accounting professor Hank Brock. Students 
trained in state and federal tax return preparation use their knowledge to provide assistance in the 
communities surrounding our campus to help low-income, older and non-English speaking 
taxpayers complete their tax returns.  

        Organizers estimate that $50 million in Earned Income Credit remains unclaimed because 
taxpayers do not file when they do not owe any tax.  

        Cal State San Bernardino students will also take part in the program. Organizers ask that 
participants call early because only a limited number of tax returns can be completed each six-
hour Saturday.

       The California Student Aid Commission is the primary state agency for the 
administration of financial aid programs available to students attending all public and private 
universities, colleges and vocational schools in California. These programs include grant, work-
study, loan assumption and loan programs supported by the state and the federal government.  
              Since its creation by the legislature in 1955, the commission has continued to evolve in 
response to the changing needs of California students and postsecondary institutions. Once a 
small state scholarship agency with a handful of employees, the commission has become a 
highly complex financial aid organization. 
              The commission and its nonprofit loan auxiliary, EDFUND, administer more than $2.4 
billion in grants and loan guarantees. The commission also provides financial aid policy analysis 
and leadership, in partnership with California's colleges, universities, financial institutions and 
financial aid associations. 
              Ortiz was also recently named to the bi-partisan independent Commission on No Child 
Left Behind. Congress is scheduled to begin reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act in 
2007, and over the next 12 to 18 months the commission will conduct a high level, independent 
and bipartisan analysis of No Child Left Behind.  
       The Commission on No Child Left Left Behind is co-chaired by former Health and 
Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson and former Georgia Governor Roy E. Barnes. 
The commission represents a vast cross section of Americas key education stakeholders.  
Commission members include: 

   •  Craig Barrett, chairman of the board, Intel Corporation  
   •  Christopher Edley, Jr, dean, University of California, Berkeley School of Law

       The NCLB commission will use several means to gather information and public input for 
its recommendations. This includes hosting five national hearings focusing on teachers, 
assessments, accountability, and sanctions and incentives. Another key element in the 
commission's efforts will be its Web site: www.nclbcommission.org, which includes background 
information on the No Child Left Behind Act, updates on Commission activities, and state-by-
state academic achievement data. The Web site allows users to submit their concerns, ideas and 
thoughts about NCLB directly to the commission.  Lastly, the commission staff will issue a 
series of white papers that highlight key NCLB policy issues.  These papers will be available on 
the Commission Web site.   
       Housed at the Aspen Institute, the commission is funded by some of the top education 
foundations in the nation, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Ewing Marion 
Kauffman Foundation, the Joyce Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation, Carnegie Corporation of New York, and the Spencer Foundation. 
       President Ortiz joined Cal Poly Pomona in August 2003. He was previously provost and 
vice president of academic affairs for California State University, Fresno from 1997 to 2003 and

                   FOR ALL-CONDITIONS FIELD FROM U.S. SOCCER FOUNDATION 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Cal Poly Pomona has been awarded a $100,000 grant from the U.S. 
Soccer Foundation that will be used to develop an all-conditions field on campus adjacent to 
Kellogg Field. The money slated for the all-conditions field is to be used for the construction of 
full-size soccer fields that can used by community and campus groups around the clock, no 
matter the weather. The grant is an initial step in the eventual construction of a lighted, all-
conditions field. 
              Cal Poly Pomona was one of 12 groups awarded a $100,000 All Conditions Fields grant 
from the U.S. Soccer Foundation, which is the major charitable arm of soccer in the United 
States. 

        This is an exciting opportunity for Cal Poly Pomona and the soccer community in the 
area, Cal Poly Pomona Director of Athletics Brian Swanson says. We are very appreciative of 
the U.S. Soccer Foundation for its support. The ability to enhance academic and athletic facilities 
while also providing additional community access allows us to better serve our past, present and 
future students, and supporters of Bronco Athletics. 

        Cal Poly Pomona Head Soccer Coach Paul Caligiuri says he looks forward to the added 
opportunities for soccer enthusiasts in the community. 

        Cal Poly Pomona has always been an excellent hub for soccer and now we have the 
opportunity to have an all-conditions field that will allow for even more participation from the 
community, he says. The grant will allow us to plan better for the future and allow more 
people on campus and in the community to enjoy a first-class facility. 
              The U.S. Soccer Foundation awarded more than $1.7 million dollars in grants this year to 
31 groups nationwide, in 18 different states. Throughout its history, the foundation has awarded 
more than $21 million to soccer groups and facilities through its annual grants program. Since 
1995, the organization has made more than $40 million available for the growth of the game of 
soccer through grants and other financial support.

      CAL POLY POMONA PROFESSOR RECEIVES COMPETITIVE $960,000 RESEARCH GRANT  
  National Institutes of Health Awards Funding Over 4 Years for Computational Modeling of Proteins 
                                                       
        Cal Poly Pomona chemistry associate professor Dr. Dennis Livesay has been chosen to 

receive a $960,000 research grant for work on Predicting Protein Flexibility and Stability from 

the National Institutes of Health. Livesay will share the grant with collaborator Dr. Donald 

Jacobs of the University of North Carolina, Charlotte.  

        Dr. Livesay received one of  the most competitive of the grants the NIH offers, says 

Dr. Donald Straney, dean of the College of Science. It represents a singular confirmation of the 

quality of Denniss work. We are fortunate to have a researcher of his caliber on campus 

working with our students. His accomplishments reflect well on the Chemistry department's 

ability to mentor students and junior faculty. 

        Livesay specializes in computational biology and bioinformatics, the use of techniques 

from applied physics, mathematics, informatics, statistics and computer science to solve 

biological problems. He and Jacobs are exploring the balance between protein flexibility and 

protein stability. This balance is critical for proteins to function properly. For example, a protein 

requires flexibility to perform a given task efficiently, but if the protein is too flexible then it may 

unfold (denature) and fail to function. Improper protein folding is linked to a variety of medical

conditions, including: cystic fibrosis, Alzheimers and even Mad Cow disease.  

       This grant will allow us to build a theoretical framework for deciphering these complex 

physical relationships that are so critical to protein function and disease, says Livesay. 

       The grant will support Livesays and Jacobss work on developing the next generation of 

the Distance Constraint Model (DCM), a unique biophysical modeling scheme that 

simultaneously calculates stability and flexibility metrics. The DCM represents a promising 

approach to understand how evolution balances protein stability and protein flexibility, whereas 

most traditional methods (computational and experimental) can only probe one or the 

other. Livesays and Jacobss project builds upon prior success of using graph-rigidity 

algorithms to identify flexible and rigid regions in proteins, and development of the Distance 

Constraint Model (DCM). 

       Livesay explains, There is only one other method that can directly evaluate the give-

and-take between stability and flexibility, called molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. 

However, MD is far too computationally expensive, even with the worlds fastest 

supercomputers, to be done on a grand scale. The DCM is extremely computationally efficient, 

and thus provides a means to quantify stability/flexibility relationships within thousands of 

proteins. Through a better understanding of these relationships, this work will drastically expand 

our basic understanding of properly functioning proteins, provide molecular-level insight into 

disease-causing mutations and should provide a direct path to improved computer-aided drug 

design.

$500,000 KECK GRANT TO FUND STATE-OF-THE-ART EXPERIMENTAL LAB AT CAL POLY POMONA 
              Experimental Facility Will Allow Imaging, Spectroscopy and Plasma Generation;  
            Computational Facility Expansion Will Make It One of the Most Powerful in the CSU 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  With a $500,000 grant from the W.M. Keck Foundation, Cal Poly 
Pomona will be creating a state-of-the-art experimental facility in its Center for Macromolecular 
Modeling and Material Design (CM       3
                                       D) that will complement its existing computational facility. 
The new experimental laboratory will provide the equipment necessary for modern experimental 
science, which has become increasingly interdisciplinary and complex.  
        The W.M. Keck Foundation grant will enable our science and engineering students to 
work in one of the most powerful computational centers housed at any undergraduate institution 
in the country, says Dr. Donald Straney, dean of the College of Science. It places us at the 
forefront of computational science and undergraduate universities nationally.  
        This support will let us build on our growing strength in nanotechnology, added Dr. 
Edward Hohmann, dean of the College of Engineering.  
        CM  3
             D brings students and faculty from chemistry, physics, engineering and computer 
science into one research center. Both CM    3
                                              D facilities will be used for undergraduate curriculum 
development and exceptional opportunities for hands-on research, which is usually reserved for 
graduate-level researchers and faculty.  
        CM  3
             D professors believe the new experimental lab will enrich learning opportunities for 
students, as the centers computer lab has done for students studying computational research. 
The new lab instruments will enable CM      3
                                             D faculty to modernize existing courses, develop new 
courses, and provide undergraduate students with interdisciplinary, capstone research projects. 
Students will gain experience in working with state-of-the-art equipment that is used in 
disciplines from medicine to space exploration.

        This is a very exciting time, says Dr. Samir Anz, a chemistry professor. The computer 
lab has had such a significant impact on our students already; were looking forward to adding 
this second component to CM     3
                                 D.  
        CM  3
             D was created in 2001 by Anz and two other chemistry professors, who pooled their 
start-up funds to create the center.  The CM   3
                                                D professors initially networked dozens of personal 
computers to create a mini-supercomputer. With the help of this computer lab, ten undergraduate 
students have had their research published in academic journals.   
        None of those papers would have been possible without the computer lab, says 
chemistry associate professor Dr. Dennis Livesay, a founding CM        3
                                                                        D faculty.  
        The W.M. Keck Foundation grant will expand CM          3

a 128-node cluster. It will create an experimental lab that centralizes equipment from different 
disciplines. These equipment groups include:  (1) an imaging lab with an atomic force 
microscope that has the ability to image biological systems, a profilometer and an elipsometer; 
(2) a laser and spectroscopy lab for biological and solid state electro-optical and magnetic 
systems; and (3) a plasma generation and teaching lab.  

                                                     

        We will be able to locate much of the major equipment necessary for modern materials 
characterization in one facility, says Dr. Phyllis Nelson, an associate professor of electrical and 
computer engineering. Before, we had to look all over campus for the right equipment. 
Coupling this new experimental lab with the computational lab will enable our students to 
experience the intersecting of simulation and measurement that is occurring in today's 
interdisciplinary research and development.

legal and illegal drugs. Topics include the use of legal drugs by children and adolescents; the 
influence of Big Pharma; the war on drugs and drug politics; drugs and crime; drugs and health 
care justice; the morality of drug use and addiction; drug safety and regulation; and the boundary 
between legal and illegal substances.  
        Most events are scheduled at Cal Poly Pomona, 3801 W. Temple Ave., in the CLA 
Building, 8 th

       Conference organizers arrived at this years theme after seeing major developments in 
drug use and regulation. They added that at the onset of the 21 st
                                                                  century, many signs suggest that 
the United States is rapidly transforming into a Drugged America, including:  
       •  Over 300,000 Americans are in prison for violating state or federal drug laws. 
       •  The Medicare drug benefit passed by Congress in 2003 may cost more than $1 trillion 
           over the next decade. 
       •  The number of high school students who acquire Ritalin, Adderall and similar 
           stimulants illegally is believed to be greater than the number who receive it with a 
           doctors prescription. 
       •  In 2002, the combined profits of the 10 drug companies listed on the Fortune 500 
           were greater than the profits of the other 490 companies combined. 
       •  Since 1990, major drug companies have spent about twice as much on marketing 
           and administration than on research and development. 
       •  The estimated annual market for illegal drugs in the U.S. is $60 billion. 

       The annual ethics conference is sponsored by Cal Poly Pomonas Institute for Ethics and 
Public Policy. All sessions are free and open to the public. Parking permits are required at Cal 
Poly Pomona, and can be purchased for $5 at the Visitor Information Booth along Kellogg

       CAL POLY POMONA TEAMS PLACE EIGHTH AT NATIONAL MOCK TRIAL TOURNAMENT 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Only in its third year, Cal Poly Pomonas Mock Trial team walked 
away with an eighth-place finish at the American Mock Trial Association Nationals 
Championship Round in St. Petersburg, Florida, March 10-12. For the first time, two Cal Poly 
Pomona teams qualified for the national tournament after a strong showing at the Western 
Regional competition Feb. 18-19.  

        At the Florida competition, Cal Poly Pomona placed eighth out of 25 schools despite a 
last-minute quandary when two team members flight from Las Vegas was delayed and roles had 
to be reassigned.  

        Before joining the mock trial team, students prepared by taking PLS 299, a Mock Trial 
class open to all majors and class levels. The course was taught by head coach Raul Sabado, a 
Los Angeles County public defender. He was aided by assistant coaches Reza Shaeri and Orsi 
Forgo. All three coaches graduated from Cal Poly Pomona before attending law school. In 
addition, a number of practicing attorneys from the community donated their time by serving as 
volunteer judges at practice sessions.  

        I only wish that I had the opportunity to learn to think and perform like a trial attorney 
when I was here at Cal Poly, said Sabado. The legal reasoning and analysis the students learn 
in this program is very similar to what is taught in law schools.

        Yellowcard's Lights and Sounds explores the highs and lows that can follow the fast track

                          Cal Poly Pomona Education Professor Receives  
                                  2006 Wang Award of Excellence 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Cal Poly Pomona education professor Doreen Nelson has been 
named one of five 2006 recipients of the prestigious California State University Wang Family 
Excellence Award. She will receive a $20,000 award at the May 2006 CSU Trustees' meeting.  
              Recognized by the New York Times as one of the 30 most innovative educators in the 
United States, Nelson pioneered the field of design thinking in education. She developed the 
nations first Master of Arts degree program in education with an emphasis on Design and 
Creativity: Applying Technology where students of any age learn to design and construct a city 
of the future in their classrooms. The methodology demonstrates how design and creativity 
enhance and extend the teaching of math, sciences, language arts and social studies. It has been 
practiced world-wide in public schools, museums and universities. 
              Nelson, who began at Cal Poly Pomona 20 years ago, teaches in the College of Education 
& Integrative Studies and in the College of Environmental Design. She received her masters in 
Educational Administration with Distinction from Cal State Northridge and her bachelors in 
Arts and Humanities from UCLA.  
              She is an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects, as well as an author, 
producer and director of educational films and a major contributor to computer design firms. 
              The Wang award was established in fall 1998 when then-Trustee Stanley T. Wang 
provided $1 million to reward outstanding faculty and administrators. The award is designed to 
celebrate those CSU faculty and administrators who, through extraordinary commitment and 
dedication, have distinguished themselves by exemplary contributions and achievements in their 
academic disciplines and areas of assignment.

       Annually, during a 10 year-period, four faculty and one administrator throughout the 
CSU system will receive $20,000 awards. This is the eighth year the awards have been given. 
              Great professors and leaders such as these sow the seeds for the next generation of 
leaders. All of these individuals have a strong passion for helping students learn and providing 
them with the best education possible, says Wang. My own professors taught me to be who I 
am today. The faculty recognition award is a way to demonstrate the great respect and deep 
appreciation I feel for them as a former trustee and student. I am a strong believer that faculty are 
the key to a high-quality education, which is the door to success and happiness in life. 
              The Wang Family Excellence Award is administered through the CSU Foundation. Each 
campus president annually may nominate one faculty member from each of the four discipline 
categories. Each president also may nominate one administrator annually.  

       The other 2006 Wang Award Recipients are: 

   •  Eugene D. Novotney, Humboldt State University, Visual and Performing Arts and Letters 

   •  Alan L. Smith, Cal State San Bernardino, Natural Sciences, Mathematical and Computer 
       Sciences and Engineering 

   •  Paul K. Longmore, San Francisco State University, Social and Behavioral Sciences and 
       Public Service 

   •  Kenneth H. Coale, San José State, University Administrator  

   Countless California State University faculty members have dedicated their lives to teaching 
students, expanding knowledge and serving both their community and their field of study. The 
CSU staff is equally dedicated to helping students achieve their goals. To choose just one in each 
category was a challenging task for the selection committee, but these individuals are all 
extraordinarily impressive, says CSU Chancellor Charles B. Reed. We are all grateful to 
Trustee Wang for providing a means to recognize these five individuals for all they do for CSU 
students.

              CAL POLY POMONA STUDENTS ORGANIZE 24-HOUR RELAY FOR LIFE  
                             TO RAISE FUNDS FOR CANCER RESEARCH 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Walkers and runners will go around the clock at Cal Poly Pomona 
in the battle against cancer during the American Cancer Society's Relay For Life of Pomona. 
Nearly 500 students, staff, faculty and community members are expected to participate in the 24-
hour relay to raise funds to fight cancer on April 29-30 in the Cal Poly Pomona University Quad.  
              Cal Poly Pomona and the city of Pomona are co-sponsoring  and ASI and other student 
groups are organizing  the on-campus event. 
              More than 40 teams will gather in the University Quad for opening ceremonies on 
Saturday, April 29, at 10 a.m. The first lap will be walked by cancer survivors in recognition of 
all who have survived the disease. The all-night event will include nonstop entertainment by live 
bands, performances by dancers and choirs, educational lectures, demonstrations and other 
family-oriented activities. 
        To honor the community's cancer survivors and to commemorate those lost to the 
disease, survivors will circle the track rimmed with glowing luminarias after sunset while the 
names of survivors and those lost to the disease are read aloud. The ceremony will be dedicated 
to former Pomona Mayor Eddie Cortez, who died of cancer earlier this year. 
              Relay For Life events will be held in more than 180 communities throughout California. 
In previous years, it has raised $18.5 million for the fight against cancer.  
        "A Relay For Life is a unique opportunity for our community to come together in the 
fight against cancer," said Brandi Carter, spokesperson for the American Cancer Society. "Many 
of the participants are cancer survivors, which serves as a reminder that our community is not 
immune to this disease and that we can actually help our friends, families and our neighbors that 
have been touched by cancer." 
        Teams  which can include co-workers, club members, family and friends who have 
obtained donations prior to the event  are asked to register by Friday, April 21. Organizers are 
also looking for event volunteers and sponsors. To register a team or to serve as a sponsor or 
volunteer, contact ASI's Candyce Otis at (909) 869-2158.

                               NATIONAL ACCREDITATION AWARDED TO  
                               CAL POLY POMONA CHILDRENS CENTER 
 
        The Cal Poly Pomona Childrens Center was awarded accreditation from the National 
Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), the most influential organization of 
early childhood educators dedicated to improving the quality of programs for children.  
        The Childrens Center will celebrate the accomplishment during its second annual Silent 
Auction and Benefit on May 12, from 6p.m. - 9p.m., at the Bronco Student Center.  
        I am thrilled to have achieved such distinction and I am honored to work with a staff 
dedicated to the education of young children, said Yvonne Bailey, director of the Childrens 
Center.  
        As the first pre-school center to receive this distinguished recognition in the greater 
Pomona area, the Cal Poly Pomona Childrens Center proves to be a leader in providing quality 
pre-school services in our community.  
        NAEYC accreditation carefully considers all aspects of a program, including health and 
safety, staff qualifications, and physical environment by measuring these areas against national 
standards of quality.  
        We have been recognized for excellence in programming as well as excellence in 
stability in our staff, said Ronii Galarneau, marketing and outreach coordinator for the 
Childrens Center. She added that accreditation will allow the Childrens Center access to 
additional grant funding, since federal state grants often require a facility to be accredited prior to 
application submittal.  
        The Cal Poly Pomona Childrens Center offers Cal Poly Pomona students, faculty, staff, 
alumni, and community members low cost quality pre-school services in a friendly, safe, and 
supportive educational environment for children 2 years of age to first grade. The summer 
enrichment program for children ages 6-10 will begin June 19.

                   Student Team Wins Regional Award for Community Outreach 
 
        For the second year in a row, the Cal Poly Pomona Students In Free Enterprise (SIFE) 
team was named one of the regions top community outreach clubs.  

        After presenting a report of its year-long community outreach projects to a panel of 
business leaders, the university's SIFE team was named a SIFE USA Regional Champion. The 
team will now advance to the national competition at the SIFE USA National Exposition, from 
May 21-23, in Kansas City, Mo.  
              During this academic year, the team developed more than 20 projects to meet definable 
needs within the Pomona community. For example, the group held an identity theft informational 
session for Cal Poly Pomona students and created a handy financial fitness guide for high school 
students. 

        The university SIFE team received an additional award in the business ethics category, 
specifically for its on-campus Business Ethics Roundtable organized by the club in Fall 2005. 
              "SIFE's motto 'Changing the World' so it's important to us to give back to the community, 
particularly an area like Pomona where a lot of needs have been identified," says Parinda Shah, 
project leader and secretary of SIFE at Cal Poly Pomona. 

        SIFE is an international non-profit organization that mobilizes university students to 
create economic opportunity for others while discovering their own potential. It is active on over 
1,800 university campuses in more than 40 countries.   
              SIFE teams create economic opportunities in their communities by organizing outreach 
projects that teach: market economics, entrepreneurship, personal financial success skills and 
business ethics. Their projects are judged at competition on creativity, innovation and 
effectiveness.

                              SODA CAN-COLLECTING ROBOTS MAY 30 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Cal Poly Pomona engineering students will take hands-on learning 
very literally. Engineering students will be testing home made Robot Soda Can Collectors for a 
Mechanical Engineering Design class on Tuesday, May 30, at 11 a.m. in front of Building 17 
(Engineering Lab).   

        ME 325 students have been challenged with designing an autonomous robot that would 
locate four soda cans placed on a course. The robot must pick the three white cans, leave them in 
a drop-off zone and return back to their original location with the black can. Students are using 
infrared and ultrasonic sensors, digital compass, and photo-resisters for robot operation. The 
entire competition takes place on a raised platform and the robots have to keep themselves on the 
table and not fall off. Each of the five student teams will have three chances each to complete the 
challenge.  

        At noon, another group of mechanical engineering students will test their bridge designs 
with weight tests. These students are enrolled in ME 214 - Vector Statics. 

        Cal Poly Pomona is located at 3801 W. Temple Ave. in Pomona. The College of 
Engineering is one of Californias premier engineering programs and the largest engineering 
school in Southern California. Established in 1957, the college has been a leader in the education 
of exemplary engineers for over 45 years. With an active enrollment of 4,300 students in seven 
academic departments, the college graduates one of every fourteen engineers in the State. Each 
year, nearly 700 engineers obtain degrees from seven departments.

        POMONA, Calif.  Cal Poly Pomona's 2006 National Model United Nations (NMUN) 
team accomplished another stellar performance at the annual NMUN conference, held April 11-
15 in New York City. The team won a coveted Outstanding Delegation Award, the highest honor 
presented by the national conference, and an Outstanding Position Paper Award. 

        This is the ninth straight year that Cal Poly Pomona has been an award-winner at the 
NMUN, the largest student-administered conference in the country. It is the third time in the past 
six years that Cal Poly Pomona has garnered both Outstanding Delegation and Outstanding 
Position Paper awards. In 2006, the conference attracted its largest number of participants, with 
more than 3,400 students from nearly 240 universities around the world in attendance. 

        Cal Poly Pomona represented the country of Hungary this year. In a rigorous preparatory 
course, students studied the history, culture, demography, politics and foreign policy of Hungary, 
the history and activities of the United Nations, world geography and current world affairs, and 
the rules and procedures of international diplomacy. 
              Students also were granted a briefing session with the Hungarian Consul General in Los 
Angeles, and, while in New York, received a briefing by the Hungarian Ambassador to the 
United Nations.  
              Cal Poly Pomona's 17-member team represented Hungary on 10 of the 24 committees, 
organizations, councils, and specialized agencies simulated at the conference.  

              The Outstanding Delegation Award places Cal Poly Pomona in approximately the top 3 
percent of colleges and universities who send their best students to the conference. The

       Faculty adviser John Moore, professor of History, says that the team's success this year is 
particularly notable because there were only two returning veterans on the 17-member team. 

       "It was, for the most part, a fresh and inexperienced team that competed with the 
conference's top teams, usually containing well-practiced and "old hand" delegates," he says. "It 
goes without saying that Cal Poly Pomona has established a top-notch reputation at this 
important annual meeting."

            CAL POLY POMONA COMMENCEMENT CEREMONIES SCHEDULED JUNE 9-11 
            Mother and Son Graduate Together and Other Details on Graduating Class 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  More than 3,000 students will take part in Cal Poly Pomonas 

commencement ceremonies June 9-11.  

        This years class includes a mother and son who will graduate together. College of 

Business Administration valedictorian Terry Lynn Prichard will be awarded a degree in 

management and human resources. Her son, Andrew Prichard, is participating in the same 

commencement ceremony, earning a degree in finance, real estate and law.  

        The 2006 graduating class also comprises the universitys first graduate students in 

regenerative studies, and three Cal Poly Pomona students who will receive the first set of 

doctorate degrees through a joint doctoral program at University of California, Irvine. In 

addition, three Renaissance Scholars will be graduating from the foster youth program. Each 

year, more than 20,000 youth age out of the foster care system and are expected to make the 

transition to adulthood independently. Cal Poly Pomona established the Renaissance Scholars 

program in January 2002 to assist foster youth in making this transition successfully. In addition 

to receiving financial aid and scholarships, Renaissance Scholars are eligible for on-campus 

housing, employment opportunities, academic advising, tutoring, health care and other services 

to help them complete their education.

Formula contests are rigorous and time consuming. Student teams must design, fabricate, and 

compete with small formula-style racecars. There are severe restrictions for car frames and 

engines, so students must be ingenious, creative and imaginative in order to challenge for the top 

prizes. It takes nearly a year to build an entry-level car that will be pitted against approximately 

140 other vehicles from colleges and universities around the world.  The Formula SAE 

competition is a working example of Cal Poly Pomonas famous learn-by-doing motto.

             AEROBIC EXERCISE BUILDS BONE DENSITY AMONG SEDENTARY WOMEN 
                         ACCORDING TO RESEARCH AT CAL POLY POMONA 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  A team of researchers at Cal Poly Pomona has released results of a 
study that may have significant implications for the prevention of osteoporosis. The researchers 
identified what is believed to be the best exercise for increasing bone mineral density in 
sedentary young women. They believe high repetition, weight-bearing step aerobic exercise is 
ideal for building bone mineral density, however, they caution that it wont take care of all of a 
womans bone health needs.   
        Osteoporosis is characterized by a decrease in bone mass and density, causing bones to 
become fragile. Cal Poly Pomona kinesiology and health promotion professor Dr. Michael T. C. 
Liang says research subjects experienced an increase of 4.4% in bone mineral density in the heel 
and a small increase of 1.4% in lumbar spine by taking part in high repetition impact-loaded 
aerobic exercise three times a week over 12 months. But its important, Liang adds, to recognize 
the value of strength training on the bones and to incorporate exercises of the upper body to 
prevent bone mineral loss in that area.   
        Most research on the relationship between exercise and bone health has been performed 
on post-menopausal women, whose bone densities are already decreasing.  Dr. Liangs research 
project is focused on younger women for the maintenance and enhancement of bone density and 
bone strength while the skeletal system is at its peak. 
        The study of 51 healthy but sedentary young women from 20 to 35 years of age was 
conducted by researchers from Cal Poly Pomona, University of California Irvine College of 
Medicine, and NASA Ames Research Center. The women were randomly assigned to one of 
three groups: aerobics, strength training and control. The 15 women who did step aerobics three 
times a week for 12 months increased the bone mineral density of their heel and first lumbar 
                                              more 

spine. No such increase occurred for the 16 women who participated in lower body muscular 
strength training and the 20 in the control group who simply did their usual mild outdoor or at-
home activities. In fact, women in the strength training and control group often showed small 
decreases in lower body bone mineral density, despite the fact all the women received 100 mg of 
daily calcium supplementation.   
              Baseline studies were taken of bone mineral density at the wrist, spine, hip and heel, 
using the standard clinical bone densitometry (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and the 
Peripheral X-ray imagery scanner). Over the 12-month period, the women did 150 hop cycles per 
week or 50 hop cycles per session during the high-impact step aerobic exercise, three times a 
week.  The hop cycle provide a loading force in their lower leg and heel equals to 2.5 to 4.5 
times their body weight.  The women who did the strength training exercises improved their leg 
strength by about 50% but they did not show any changes in bone density in the heel, leg or 
lumbar spine.  The area where aerobics failed to produce results was the hip.  
              None of the women showed any improvement in lower leg bone bending strength, a 
measure used by NASA to evaluate bone strength in astronauts after space flight. Bone bending 
strength was measured by a special instrument co-invented by a NASA scientist and a Stanford 
University professor in mechanical engineering. 
       This research was funded by a $1.4 million grant from the National Institutes of Health. 
Dr. Liang is planning to examine different ethnic/racial groups, such as Hispanics, Asians, 
African-American and Caucasians, to determine whether lifestyle, diet, leisure-time activities or 
other factors can affect young womens bone health. 
       Dr. Liang presented the results to the American Physiological Society scientific sessions 
at the Experimental Biology 2006 annual meeting in San Francisco. In the study presented at the 
Experimental Biology meeting, coauthors with Dr. Liang are Dr. Stanley L. Bassin, Cal Poly 
Pomona; Dr. William A. Braun, Shippensburg University; Dr. Darren J. Dutto, Eastern Oregon 
State University; Drs. Nathan D. Wong and Dan M. Cooper, University of California Irvine 
College of Medicine; Dr. Sara B. Arnaud, NASA Ames Research Center Life Science Division, 
California; and graduate students from the Department of Kinesiology and Health Promotion, at 
Cal Poly Pomona.

    CAL POLY ROSE FLOAT RELEASES RENDERING FOR 2007 TOURNAMENT OF ROSES FLOAT 
              Walnut Creek Companys Float Concept Chosen for Rose Parade Entry 
         
        POMONA, Calif.  It may be 90 
degrees outside, but the Cal Poly 
Universities Rose Float team have the 
arctic in mind. The Pomona and San Luis 
Obispo campuses have released the final 
rendering of their 2007 Tournament of 
Roses Parade entry, Arctic Antics.  

        Arctic Antics depicts a group of 
polar bears and penguins brightening up 
their snowy surroundings by hosting a Hawaiian-themed party.  

        Our Good Nature is the theme of the 118th Rose Parade, scheduled on Monday, Jan. 1, 
2007 at 8 a.m. (PST). The Cal Poly Universities float concept originated from Thomas Baak & 
Associates of Walnut Creek, who submitted the idea into the universities Rose Float design 
contest in February. The company will receive a $1,000 cash prize and four tickets to the 
Tournament of Roses Parade on New Year's Day in Pasadena where the winning float design 
will be viewed by millions. 

        The Cal Poly Universities is really known for its great animation shows, and this 
concept really stood out to us because of its numerous fun elements and potential for animation, 
said Janetta McDowell, senior coordinator of the Office of Student Life & Rose Float. The 
students started construction about one to two months ahead of schedule. They're really excited 
about Arctic Antics, and come New Year's Day everyone will see why!

Cal Poly Pomona  2007 Rose Float Rendering Released 
Page 2 of 2 

       Students from the Cal Poly Universities in San Luis Obispo and Pomona have designed, 
constructed, decorated and financed entries to the Tournament of Roses Parade every year since 
1949. Involvement in this project highlights the Cal Poly Universities learn-by-doing 
philosophy as students develop these decorative floats from design conception to welding 
together steel and pasting petals to driving the contraption down Colorado Boulevard.  

       The two campuses, located approximately 225 miles apart, manage to coordinate the 
effort to complete the float for each parade. Throughout the 12-month period, both student 
committees work closely together on the design and construction of their respective portion to 
ensure the float is built to specification.

        POMONA, Calif.  Cal Poly Pomona vice president 
for administrative affairs Patricia Farris announced Friday, June 
30, that she will retire from her position as the universitys chief 
financial officer on Sept. 1.  
        Farris said that she and her husband Bob have been 
considering retirement for quite some time.  
        There is never a good time to leave a job that you love, 
except perhaps when you do love it, said Farris. I have spent 
26 years in higher education, and am proud to have worked with 

the great people at Cal Poly Pomona. Now I am looking                    Patricia Farris. Photo available for

forward to the opportunity for Bob and I to enjoy more time              www.csupomona.edu/news.  
together. 
         Farris has had a long and productive history with Cal Poly Pomona and the California 
State University system. She has steadfastly led the Division of Administrative Affairs for more 
than a decade. She took instrumental roles in the large-scale construction of much-needed 
buildings on campus, including for Science, Engineering, Residential Suites, the universitys first 
parking structure, and her favorite project, a pedestrian walkway through the campus. During 
recent budget reduction years, Farris worked hard to ensure Cal Poly Pomona did not experience 
layoffs.  
        Before coming to Cal Poly Pomona, Farris helped to launch the CSU San Marcos campus 
by establishing its foundation and first three buildings. Prior to joining higher education, she and

                     Cal Poly Pomona Workshops Teach Eco-Friendly Living 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Cal Poly Pomona is hosting a timely series of eco-friendly 
workshops useful to the average Californian. In conjunction with the Real Goods Solar Living 
Institute, the universitys The John T. Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies will offer a diverse 
range of workshops from July 31 to Aug. 6, with all classes running from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
         These workshops offer tips on how to work with nature rather than against it, using 
simple strategies and easily obtainable materials. Courses are as follows: 
        •   Introduction to Natural BuildingFrom July 31Aug. 1, attendees will focus on 
            creating natural buildings using natural materials, particularly straw-bale construction 
            and other alternative building materials.  
        •   Ecological Urban GardeningOn Aug. 2, attendees will learn how to create an 
            effective and ecological garden space in the city, using sustainable urban gardening 
            methods such as planters and rooftop boxes.  
        •   How to Make and Use BiodieselOn Aug. 3, participants will explore an effective 
            alternative to fossil fuel. Biodiesel is made of raw or used vegetable oil or animal fats 
            and can be used in diesel engines.  
        •   Water RecyclingOn Aug. 4, workshop attendees will receive an overview of 
            aquatic sciences and learn more about alternative wastewater treatment and storm 
            water capture and storage.  
        •   Introduction to Grid-Tied PV SystemsFrom Aug. 5-6, students will learn how to 
            effectively beat rising energy costs by installing a photovoltaic solar energy system 
            that ties directly into home electrical grids.   
        A changing world creates new challenges, and the Lyle Center specializes in proposing 
effective responses that support a healthy living environment. To register for the Solar Living 
workshops, visit www.solarliving.org or call (707) 744-2017. For additional information, contact 
the Lyle Center at (909) 869-5155. Workshops cost $120 per day, or you may sign up for the 
entire series and receive $100 off.

                     Expert in Latin American and Mexican History Chosen As 
         2006-2007 Weglyn Endowed Chair of Multicultural Studies at Cal Poly Pomona 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Author and educator Dr. Enrique C. Ochoa has been selected as the 
2006-2007 Michi and Walter Weglyn Endowed Chair of Multicultural Studies at Cal Poly 
Pomona. He will join the university Aug. 1. 
        The universitys Michi and Walter Weglyn Endowed Chair is devoted to promoting the 
interdisciplinary study of ethnic and racial minority groups in the United States. The chair 
designs programs that prepare students with the knowledge and skills they need to meet the 
ongoing challenge of living and working in a culturally and ethnically diverse society.  
        Dr. Ochoa is a history professor at California State University, Los Angeles. His areas of 
specialization include Latin American, Mexican, and Central American history; the United States 
and Mexico border; immigration; globalization; and Latinas/os in the United States. Dr. Ochoa is 
the author of Feeding Mexico: The Political Uses of Food Since 1910, and co-editor of Latino 
Los Angeles: Transformations, Communities, and Activism with Gilda L. Ochoa.  
        He looks forward to working on a campus-community based project that combines 
research, teaching, and community interests in food, culture and power. Cal Poly Pomona's 
historic connection to agriculture and food research provides an opportunity to have the Eastern 
San Gabriel Valley and Pomona as a case study. Ochoa seeks to engage the campus and 
community in conversation about the ways global and local transformations in the production, 
distribution, consumption, and marketing of food interact with issues of race, class and gender. 
         Ochoa received his bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees in history from UCLA.

         Cal Poly Pomona Undergraduate Scholars Showcase Research Results July 27 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Eighteen bright Cal Poly Pomona researchers are investigating 

topics such as Californias potential for a levee failure, local traffic safety, and childrens 

attachment to pets. But these researchers arent faculty members; theyre undergraduate students 

participating in the Cal Poly Pomona McNair Scholars Program.  

        The universitys 18 McNair scholars will showcase results of their months of intensive 

research during the seventh annual McNair Scholars Program Summer Symposium, July 27, 

from 9 to 11:30 a.m. in the universitys Bronco Student Center.  

        Named for Ronald E. McNair, best known as one of the astronauts aboard the 1986 

Challenger shuttle, the federally-funded program encourages first-generation, low-income or 

underrepresented students to earn doctoral degrees through involvement with research, mentors, 

seminars and financial aid.  

        McNair Scholars present their research results at a symposium held on campus and at 

national conferences. University McNair Scholars have presented their research at conferences 

such as the American and Western Psychological Association conferences, the Southern 

California Conference on Undergraduate Research, and the Annual California McNair Scholars 

Symposium at UC Berkeley, among others.

            ENGINEERING STUDENTS DESIGN RUBE GOLDBERG CONTRAPTIONS  
           TO TEE A GOLF BALL WITHOUT BENDING OVER AT CAL POLY POMONA 
 
      STORY/PHOTO     In a classic example of hands-on learning, mechanical engineering students 
     OPPORTUNITY:     have designed and built Rube Goldberg style machines designed to tee 
                      up a golf ball without bending over. The golf ball must traverse from a 
                      starting point, through each portion of the machine and end up on the 
                      tee. In addition to the goal of teeing the ball, instructor Mariappan Jawa 
                      Jawaharlal challenged his 22 students (working in 10 teams) to produce an 
                      effect that would captivate a casual passerby. The project is a part of 
                      Mechanical Engineering 421  Dynamics of Machinery.  

                      One of 14 engineers in California is a graduate of Cal Poly Pomona. Cal

                    FOAL PATROL! CAL POLY POMONA ARABIAN HORSE CENTER 
                               EXPECT 15 NEW FOALS IN THE SPRING 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  It's going to be a busy spring at Cal Poly Pomonas W.K. Kellogg 
Arabian Horse Center. As of late 15 mares are pregnant, which is more than double compared to 
last year. 
         Eighteen mares have been artificially inseminated and 15, possibly 16, are expecting. 
Normally only 60 percent to 70 percent of artificial inseminations are successful. 
         Anything above 80 percent is considered excellent, says Animal and Veterinary 
Sciences Professor and Veterinarian Jim Alderson, who gives the horses their checkups. We're 
doing really good. 
         The Arabian Horse Center relies heavily on the sale of its horses to survive financially, 
so the surge in foals could result in a big boost in sales. The center has sold horses from 
anywhere between $1,500 and $75,000.  
         Farm Manager Kate Smith conducted the inseminations. She meticulously monitored the 
Arabian mares' menstrual cycles and ordered stallion sperm just at the right time. Mares have a 
12-hour window in which they can become pregnant, so the logistics can be tricky. The stallion 
sperm is extracted, chilled in a cooler and flown in from a few locations across the country. 
         On a few occasions, the FedEx shipments arrived at Ontario International Airport at 11 
p.m. When the shipments arrived late, Smith picked up the specimens at the airport and returned 
to the horse center to conduct the inseminations in the middle of the night. 
         Prize-winning breeders donate the stallion specimens to the Arabian Horse Center. The 
donations are a much-needed cost savings because the fair-market value tends to be in the 
thousands, Smith said.

         The first foals are expected this February and several are due in March. In one week in 
alone, six babies are expected, Smith said.  
         Near the end of their 11-month pregnancies, an electronic device is attached to the mares' 
bodies. When they begin to give birth the device sets off a buzzer to alert a few students who live 
at the center and sends a page to about five staff members, Smith said. 
         The work will be daunting birthing up to 16 foals, so the horse center is looking for 
student volunteers to create a foal watch club.  
         We definitely would like to have more students involved down here, she said. It's 
almost impossible for us to do it on our own. 
         The horse center is apart of the world-famous Kellogg Ranch, which was established in 
1925 by cereal magnate W.K. Kellogg. Kellogg grew to love horses as a boy when he owned a 
half-Arabian pony, but when he parted with Old Spot he vowed that some day he would have 
horses and that they would all be Arabians. After achieving outstanding success in the cereal 
food business, he realized his boyhood ambition by establishing the Kellogg Ranch as one of the 
world's foremost Arabian breeding farms. 
         In 1949, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation donated the 813-acre ranch and horses to the 
university under the condition that Cal Poly Pomona would continue to utilize the Arabian horses 
in equine science education and breeding. Today, the university's comprehensive educational 
program includes instruction at the W.K. Kellogg Arabian Horse Center, Sunday exhibition 
shows that run from October to May, the Equine Research Center established in 1980, and 
clinics offered to the surrounding community. Information: (909) 869-4988.

more than 1,400 accredited four-year schools across the nation. Academic performance is 
measured on as many as 15 different indicators divided into seven categories including peer 
assessment, retention, faculty resources, student selectivity, financial resources, graduation rate 
performance and alumni giving rate. While well known, the national magazine is also often 
criticized for its methodology.

             MOBILE FOOD PANTRY DELIVERS CAL POLY POMONA-GROWN PRODUCE  
                               TO LOW-INCOME POMONA RESIDENTS  
                       Deliveries to Senior Center Scheduled Sept. 5, 12, 19 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Faculty in the Human Nutrition and Food Science Department 
began a mobile food pantry program this summer in hopes to provide a steady stream of fresh 
produce to low-income residents of Pomona. 

        For most of the summer, Cal Poly Pomona-grown produce has been passed out for free 
on a weekly basis to low-income, elderly Hispanic women at the Washington Park Senior Center 
in order to study and improve their diet and nutrition.  

        Were trying to increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables by elderly Hispanic 
women, says assistant professor Susan Algert. Many of these women, who are at high-risk of 
hypertension and diabetes, have not been able to incorporate enough fruit and vegetables into 
their diet because of accessibility and cost. Some of them dont have enough money to eat three 
meals a day. 

        Elena Rodriguez, site manager at the Washington Park Senior Center, said the 41 
participants are pleased and eager to collect their 11 pounds of fresh produce each week. 

        They seem to be eating more vegetables and fruit, Rodriguez said. They really like the 
idea. 

        Algert and Douglas Lewis, chair of Human Nutrition and Food Science, spearheaded a 
study with the universitys Center for GIS Research and in partnership with the Inland Valley 
Council of Churches. The study mapped out where IVCCs food pantry clients lived in relation 
to where they could buy fresh produce. Many food pantry clients do not drive and must walk to 
stores in order to buy groceries.

Cal Poly Pomona  Mobile Food Pantry Delivers Produce to Low-Income Residents 
Page 2 of 2 

       The study titled Disparities in Access to Fresh Produce in Low-Income Neighborhoods 
in Los Angeles showed 59 percent of the 3,985 food pantry clients in 2003 did not live within 
walking distance (1/2 mile) of a store that sold fresh produce. The study was published in May 
the American Journal of Preventive Medicine and is available online. 
       The benefits of fresh produce are many. Numerous epidemiologic studies show that 
adequate levels of fruit and vegetable consumption helps prevent cardiovascular disease, obesity 
and increases health overall, Algert says. 
       The mobile food pantry program ultimately aims to deliver fresh produce to the most 
under-served and low-income neighborhoods of Pomona. This summers study has focused on 
women at one senior center, but if funding permitted, produce would not be limited to that group, 
Lewis says. 
       In addition to improving the health of a low-income population, the program creates 
ample opportunities for more student- and faculty-led research in the community. The program 
allows students to develop nutrition education materials and conduct nutrition  events and 
outreach in Pomona as part of their coursework, Algert said. 
       A few years have been spent researching; developing partnerships; and acquiring grants 
to get this point. Recently, Algert and Lewis obtained a $20,000 from the Agricultural Research 
Initiative and $25,000 from UPS (United Parcel Service of America) which has been used to buy 
the produce and a large van, which serves as the mobile food pantry. 
       Funding for the current study runs out in the middle of September and work is underway 
to secure more funds to keep the project going. Ultimately, Lewis and Algert hope that funding 
streams will be developed and the program can be operated on a regular basis by the IVCC, 
which currently runs a food pantry and a weekly farmers market.  
       FOR MEDIA: The mobile food pantry will be delivering food to the Washington Park 
Senior Center, 865 E Grand Ave, Pomona, on Sept. 5, 12 and 19 between 11 a.m. and 12:30 
p.m. The produce will be packed at about 10:30 a.m. those days at the Cal Poly Pomona Farm 
Store, 4102 S. University Drive, Pomona. (The study will conclude on Sept. 12, though food will 
be passed out again on Sept. 19.)

          INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND MARKETING STUDENTS AT CAL POLY POMONA 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Up to 100 Cal Poly Pomona students and faculty will be able to set 
up online surveys, analyze user feedback, and use the results to conduct marketing research 
thanks to a grant from WebSurveyor, an online business survey provider.  

        Professor Sijun Wang in the International Business & Marketing (IBM) department 
received the two-year grant, which will extend through Aug. 21, 2008. In return for the software 
package, she will provide a white paper on the products functionality.  

        Online surveys are a great way to construct a questionnaire and collect data in a short 
time, which works well for a quarter-system campus, said Dr. Wang. It used to be that students 
had to buy a textbook to gain access to the software, but because of the grant they now have 
access for free.  

        Valued at $50,000, WebSurveyor's online survey tools allow organizations to conduct an 
unlimited number of surveys. Wangs students will use the companys software for Web-based 
surveys in IBM 408: Marketing Research, and IBM 409: Advanced Marketing Research. In

        POMONA, Calif.  To raise awareness about domestic violence, Cal Poly Pomona hosts

defense classes, a march and rally, the powerful Clothesline Project and a special art exhibit by 
survivors. 
        The following events are open to the public. For more information, contact Diane Sands

Office provides education, training and support services for issues surrounding sexual assault, 
domestic violence, and stalking on campus.

clothesline symbolizes the way their unique stories are strung together to create a shared 
experience. Airing the shirts represents publicly airing society's dirty laundry. Victims of hate 
crimes will be remembered in the hate crime memorial, a series of silhouettes placed throughout 
the park.

himself and give him focus. He would have wanted to help people this way." 

         As a Cal Poly Pomona junior, Matthew was nearing graduation and deciding on a career 
path to follow. He was thinking about a service-oriented career, possibly ministry work, Chris 
Myers says.  She believes her son's aim to pursue a career dedicated to serving others and his 
commitment to physical fitness plant the perfect seeds to honor his life with a memorial run.  

         The 5K course begins and end where Matthew was struck while he walked across 
Kellogg Drive near the Arabian Horse Center. A memorial of silk flowers, a white wooden cross 
and running shoes still remain at the site. On the day of the event a permanent memorial will be 
unveiled.

       FEDERAL DOLLARS UPGRADE AEROSPACE ENGINEERING LAB AT CAL POLY POMONA 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Congresswoman Grace F. Napolitano (D-38) recently secured $1 
million in federal funding for Cal Poly Pomona's aerospace engineering laboratory. 
              This funding helps purchase and install a three-dimensional Laser Doppler Velocimeter 
(LDV) system and aerospace computer simulation systems. The equipment will be used for 
research in aerodynamics and fluid dynamics in the new subsonic and supersonic wind tunnels in 
the aerospace engineering department.  
              "This is not just ordinary air blowing," says Ali Ahmadi, chair of the aerospace 
engineering department. "This is a clean, very smooth, very uniform air flow." 
              A growing number of students in Cal Poly Pomona's aerospace engineering programs 
receive critical training from these resources, enabling local firms to continue hiring highly 
skilled graduates. 
              Napolitano has already secured $2 million for this project over the past two years, 
contributing to the $4.5 million needed to finish upgrades to the laboratory.  
              This recent funding was included in the 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations 
Bills. 
              The College of Engineering's partnership with the U.S. Air Force and the 
congresswoman's ability to secure federal dollars has enabled the acquisition and installation of 
the two  new research-grade wind tunnels.   
              The supersonic wind tunnel simulates flying conditions up to four times the speed of 
sound. The second structure is a subsonic wind tunnel, which maxes out at 200 miles per hour 
and simulates wind speeds during aircraft take off and landing and low-speed flight.  
              The new tunnels replace two older versions in need of repair, one of which was installed 
42 years ago and nowhere near the caliber of the new counterparts. The new subsonic tunnel is 
under construction and will be online in spring 2007, and the supersonic equipment will be 
operational near the end of 2007.

              The actual test section for the tunnels is quite small: the larger test section is in the 
subsonic tunnel, and it is 40 inches wide, 28 inches tall and about 78 inches long. The supersonic 
test space is just 8-inches tall and wide, and 24 inches long. However, these tiny test sections 
need a great deal of real estate to create wind at high speeds. These are massive machines with 
the larger subsonic tunnels footprint measuring 54 feet long and 23 feet wide.  
              The new tunnels are part of a 2004 Education Partnership Agreement between the 
university and the Air Force. The equipment will be on long-term loan to Cal Poly Pomona and 
will be utilized by students, companies in the aerospace industry and other universities, as well 
as the Air Force itself. They are also part of an outreach program for K-12 students with on-
campus tours to promote interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. 
              "In essence, this is a loan from the U.S. Air Force to us for a number of years, and then 
eventually ownership may revert to the campus," says Edward Hohmann, dean of the College of 
Engineering.   This type of education is important to both the local and national economies, 
according to Hohmann.  
              "One of the reasons the Air Force is helping us is that there just aren't that many people 
being trained in the United States who are familiar with the details in designing aircraft, 
including testing them in wind tunnels," Hohmann says. "A number of countries, especially India 
and China, are producing a lot of engineers, and the United States has been lagging in that area. 
So, we are pleased that our enrollment has drastically increased over the last several years in the 
College of Engineering with nearly 4,300 students currently." 
              The aerospace engineering program has also seen rapid growth over the last decade, and 
about 350 students are currently participating in the program. Ahmadi attributes this to the 
considerable job market in Southern California. 
              "There are tens of thousands of high-paying aerospace jobs in California," he says. 
"Southern California has always been one of the largest centers for aerospace work in the world. 
Even though we are not building many airplanes here now, there's still a lot of industry research 
and development taking place locally."  
              Cal Poly Pomona and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo are the only two pure aerospace 
programs in the Cal State University system, which means its students are in demand.  
              "One in 14 engineers in California is a graduate of our College of Engineering," says 
Hohmann. "We have a large program, and we've built a very strong reputation for producing 
workforce-ready graduates during our 50-year history."

       While best known for her work on Broadway, Egan has also amassed numerous movie 
and television credits, including roles in 13 Going on 30 and two seasons on the WBs Nikki.  

       Winer, a personal friend of Egan, invited her to campus. The two met in New York when 
Winer worked as the mastering engineer for her solo album Coffee House. 

       Egan previously came to Cal Poly Pomona to provide a master class for students in the 
spring. The event was so successful the benefit concert for the Music Industry Studies Program 
was soon in the works. 

       The Cal Poly Pomona Music Industry Studies Program is one of the most unique 
and affordable programs of study in the nation. The rapidly-growing program currently 
comprises half of the music departments 190 majors. MIS students may follow tracks in music 
business, production or recording. The program's wide-ranging curriculum provides students 
with a deep knowledge of music theory, performance, production, recording technology, and 
businessas well as a well-rounded university education. In preparation for careers in music, all 
MIS students complete internships throughout the music industry. 

       We currently dont have a scholarship for these students yet, said Winer. These are 
very talented students. Many have part-time jobs while also balancing their school work and 
internships. Theyre also expected to remain high-level musicians as well. Theyre under a lot of 
pressure, and many need financial help. Thats why this benefit concert is so important. 

       The concert performance is expected to sell out. Organizers suggest purchasing tickets in 
advance by calling (909) 869-3554. Tickets are $25 general admission, $15 for students. VIP 
packages, which include a cocktail reception with Susan Egan, start at $100 and are available by 
calling Lisa Nashua at (909) 869-6848.

                             BAT EXPERT AT CAL POLY POMONA DISPELS  
             POPULAR HALLOWEEN MYTHS ABOUT MYSTERIOUS NOCTURNAL ANIMAL 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Bats are so misunderstood.  

        Particularly around Halloween, myths proliferate about the mysterious creature. Is it a 
bloodsucking, flying rodent? Do they attack in hordes at night? Does their blindness cause them 
to tangle in peoples hair?  

        No, no, no, says bat expert Dr. Donald Straney, dean of the Cal Poly Pomona College 
of Science. Especially during this time of year, all the myths and misunderstandings come to the 
fore. Bats are real improbable animals. Theyre just full of surprises, but theyre often not what 
people think they are.  

        Prior to heading the College of Science at Cal Poly Pomona, Straney was a professor of 
zoology at Michigan State University for 23 years. A specialist in bats and bat evolution, Straney 
helped sort bat fact from bat fiction.  

        Q: Do bats survive by sucking blood? 

        A: There are 45 different types of bats in the United States and over 900 in the world, 
many with very unusual attributes. Real vampire bats exist, and live off blood, but they dont 
wear capes and they dont live in Transylvania. They live in Latin America, where they make a 
small bite on animals such as cows and pigs, and then lick up the blood. Many bats simply live 
off fruits and nectar or insects.  

        Q: Are bats flying rodents? 

        A: While bats are furry like mice, they are more closely related to monkeys.

Cal Poly Pomona  Bat Fact from Fiction 
Page 2 of 2 

       Q: Do bats attack in hordes at night? 
       A: Absolutely not. Maybe because people see bats as a large flock flying together, they 
think they swarm, but they dont swarm people and harm them. To bats, were this big thing that 
might as well be a tree. They understand food, but to them food is an insect or a fig on a tree, not 
something that looks like us.  
       Q: Does a bats blindness cause them to tangle in peoples hair? 
       A: Thats a big one. I hear it all the time. First, they are not blind as a bat, so to speak. 
Second, they do not tangle in your hair. Ive stood in the entrance of caves with millions of bats 
leaving the cave in a steady stream and Ive never been hit. They know youre there and your 
hair is there, and they would rather avoid you. Bat sonar is very good. In fact, by studying bat 
sonar, the Navy developed many sonar applications during World War II.  
       Q: Do bats carry life-threatening diseases? 
       A: Like many other animals, they can carry diseases. Some carry rabies, which is most 
often fatal. In the natural populations of bats, a very small percentage has rabies. The important 
thing to remember is that bats that are out during the day or hanging low on a tree are behaving 
strangely. There is a high chance that those are sick and rabid. That can be dangerous because 
when the bats are sick they are within easy reach of children.  
       Q: Are there any bats in the Greater Los Angeles/San Bernardino area?  
       A: There are many bats in the area representing 17 species. Some roost in the dried 
fronds on palm trees, some rest in steep attics, and many are in caves and crevices in hills. They 
come out and drink at night. Oftentimes, especially in the hills, you can see them come down at 
night and drink in swimming pools. One bat only flies after midnight. The spotted bat (euderma 
maculatum) has huge pink ears, black fur and three big white spots on its back that make it look 
like a flying skull. Another bat in the desert walks on the ground and feeds on scorpions. Theyre 
really bizarre, and theyre right in our backyard.

                   PUBLIC INVITED TO DIA DE LOS MUERTOS (DAY OF THE DEAD) 
                            CELEBRATION AT CAL POLY POMONA NOV. 2 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Close to 500 people are expected to attend the 12          th
                                                                                      annual Dia de 
los Muertos celebration at Cal Poly Pomona on Thursday, Nov. 2, from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. Also 
known as Day of the Dead, the traditional Mexican holiday honors those who have passed 
through music, dance, storytelling, food, and the creation of altars or ofrendas. 
        Day of the Dead makes it sound like it might be a sad or gloomy, but its actually a 
celebration of life. Its very fun, especially for children, said Cecilia Santiago, coordinator of 
the Cesar E. Chavez Center for High Education, one of Cal Poly Pomonas five cultural centers.   
        Beginning at 3 p.m., free face painting will be offered at the Cesar E. Chavez Center for 
Higher Education near the University Quad. A procession begins at 5 p.m. in University Quad 
and moves to nearby University Park, where the main event will be held. 
        This years celebration features a special concert by Los Angeles band QUETZAL at 
7:30 p.m. in University Park. The fusion band blends its Mexican roots with rock, folk and Afro-
Cuban influences. In addition, performances include a dance featuring 24 teachers from Mexico 
participating in a one-year English Language Institute program. Classes, campus organizations 
and community partners will also create more than a dozen ofrendas for public viewing.  
        The 12 th
                 annual Dia de los Muertos celebration is sponsored by Ethnic & Womens 
Studies, the Cesar E. Chavez Center for Higher Education, ASI Beat, and the Multicultural 
Council.  
        In the event of rain, Dia de los Muertos events will be held in the Bronco Student 
Centers Ursa Major Suite. For more information about the event, call the Cesar E. Chavez 
Center for Higher Education at (909) 869-5035.

                      CAL POLY POMONA MASTERS STUDENT HONORED FOR  
         OUTSTANDING ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT IN THE FACE OF PERSONAL HARDSHIPS 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Although her childhood was troubled by parental illness and death, 
a winter of homelessness in Chicago, and financial need that sent her to work at 14, Lesley 
Felton is proof positive that higher education is accessible and achievable.  

        Felton, a 27-year-old Pomona resident, is now an honors student working her way to a 
masters degree in Cal Poly Pomonas competitive architecture program. 

        For her outstanding academic achievements, community service and significant personal 
achievements, Felton was recently awarded the 2006-07 William R. Hearst/CSU Trustees 
Award for Outstanding Achievement.  

        The award provides $3,000 scholarships to students who have demonstrated financial 
need, experienced personal hardships and have attributes of merit including superior academic 
performance, exemplary community service, and significant personal achievements.  

        This is really exciting, said Felton. Its not pocket money for pizza. Its helping me 
offset the need to work. The architecture graduate program is really rigorous, so this is definitely 
going to help a lot.  

        Felton started studying at Cal Poly Pomona in 2004. Previously, she worked as a 
handyman, running a construction company with her fiancé in Northern California. Business was 
booming, but they both wanted to do more.  

        We felt like we werent making the contribution to the environment and society we 
wanted to make to feel content, she said. 

        Felton enrolled in the universitys graduate architecture program, with a focus on 
environmental sustainability while her fiancé worked toward a masters in regenerative studies.

        Lesley is probably one of the most proactive, engaged, involved, wont-take-no-for-an-
answer students Ive ever had. Shes a real joy to be around, said professor Kip Dickson, 
graduate coordinator of the Architecture program. Shes got the most incredible leadership 
potential. I think a lot of that has to do with the passion that she has and her desire for 
knowledge. Shes the type of student where you are very confident that they will go on to do 
important things when they graduate.  
        As a case in point of her can-do attitude, Dickson noted that for years architecture 
professors were discussing the possibility of creating a focus in environmental sustainability. 
While discussions were taking place, the progress was slow. 
        Lesley went and organized the students. She convinced the students how important it 
would be to push this with faculty, he said. She was instrumental in pushing it along. 
        In the last year, the program was developed and codified.  
        Felton credits her success to a strong network of friends and family, including her older 
sister, fiancé, professors and fellow graduate architecture students. 
        For the first few years, my graduate class took all our classes together and were very 
close. Without this group of people, who pitch in and help pull each other through, I dont know 
if I could have made it through as far as I have. 
        When asked about youths who may be facing personal challenges and questioning 
whether earning a college degree is really possible, Felton offered some advice and 
encouragement.  
        Id say, get the education now. The money is out there. It can be a challenge in terms of 
finding scholarships and grants, but there are always loans. The toughest part is figuring out what 
you love to do. The money part will work itself out. 
        At Cal Poly Pomona, undergraduate fees for a full academic year are only $3,015. 
Graduate student fees are $3,597. University of California colleges cost more than twice as 
much. Private colleges can charge as much as $30,000 a year.

                E-WASTE COLLECTION PROGRAM AT CAL POLY POMONA OPEN TO  
                RESIDENTS OF DIAMOND BAR, POMONA, SAN DIMAS AND WALNUT 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  As a public service, Cal Poly Pomona and Electronic Recyclers are 
establishing an Electronic Waste Collection Program to help members of the university 
community and its neighbors dispose of e-waste in a safe manner that will protect the 
environment. 

        On Saturday, Nov. 18, any member of the campus community or resident of Pomona, San 
Dimas, Diamond Bar and Walnut may bring their unwanted electronics for easy disposal. The E-
Waste Roundup runs from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and will take place in Parking Lot K at the 
corner of Temple Avenue and University Drive.  

        As of Feb. 9 when the Electronic Waste Recycling Act went into effect, most electronics 
cannot be legally disposed of in the trash.  

        "E-waste is the most rapidly growing segment of the municipal waste stream," says 
David Patterson, director of the university's Environmental Health & Safety department. "These 
materials should no longer be disposed of in municipal landfills because the toxic substances 
may enter the environment via ground water or other mechanisms." 

        E-Waste comprises 2 percent to 5 percent of the municipal solid waste stream. E-waste is 
a general category of electronic products including broken or obsolete televisions, computer 
monitors, central processing units (CPU), cordless and cell phones, cash registers, videocassette 
recorders, cell phones, copiers and printers, stereos and speakers, microwaves, X-ray machines, 
and some scientific equipment. These products often contain toxic materials such as lead, 
barium, mercury and cadmium, which require proper management as well as valuable resources 
that should be recovered.

        Beginning Jan. 1, 2005, California consumers began paying a fee ranging from $6 to $10 
at the time of purchase of certain video display devices. The fees are deposited into a special 
account to be paid to qualified e-waste collectors and recyclers to cover their costs of managing 
these devices when they are discarded.  

        Due to the 2005 law, some electronic devices can be discarded at the Nov. 18 roundup 
without charge. Those devices include: computer monitors (cathode ray tubes, plasma, LCD) and 
visual display devices, including televisions, (w/screens over 4 inches diagonally).  

        Personal computer components, PDAs, cell phones, printers, fax machines, microwave 
ovens, video/DVD equipment and stereo/audio equipment will be accepted at $0.25/pound.  

        The money collected will be used to fund the program. Any money above operating 
expenses will be used to support environmental protection and safety programs at the university.

               NEW PROGRAM PREPARES COMMUNITY COLLEGE MATH EDUCATORS; 
         Cal Poly Pomona Math Education Program Addresses Math Teacher Shortage  
 
        POMONA, Calif.  The Cal Poly Pomona department of Mathematics & Statistics is 
launching a new graduate program designed to train students how to teach mathematics at the 
community-college level. 

         The department is adding an emphasis in mathematics education to its master's in 
mathematics program. The emphasis would require students to take rigorous graduate-level math 
courses in addition to a series of courses designed to make them effective teachers.  

        The emphasis is also designed for graduate students who are planning to earn a Ph.D. and 
secondary math teachers who wish to take on leadership roles in math education. 

        Several alumni who are teaching at community colleges were very supportive of this 
program and wish they had it when they were enrolled here, says Barbara Shabell, chair of 
Mathematics & Statistics. At least half of our grad students end up teaching at community 
colleges.   

        The need for highly qualified math teachers is evident throughout the state in all levels of 
K-16 education, and work is being done to increase those numbers. The California State 
Universities and California Community Colleges recently signed a compact to align their 
programs more to make it easier for community college students to transfer smoothly into a CSU 
program. The partnership is part of a larger CSU initiative launched in 2004 to at least double the 
number of K-12 math and science teachers over the next five years to a minimum of 1,500 new 
teachers in these fields by 2009-2010. 

         Aside from the new program at Cal Poly Pomona and one at Cal State San Diego, which 
has a joint mathematics education Ph.D. program with UC San Diego, there are few other

graduate programs designed to prepare students to teach at community colleges and go onto a 
Ph.D. program. 

         A number of California State Universities offer graduate programs in mathematics 
education, but they are designed mostly for prospective K-12 math teachers, Shabell says. 

         Members of the math faculty began to research the need for this program a few years ago 
when they heard anecdotal evidence suggesting community colleges gave preference to 
prospective faculty candidates who had formal pedagogical training in addition to training in 
their discipline.  

         To see if there was validity to the claim, they set out to survey several Southern 
California-based community colleges. 

         Of the 39 community college math departments surveyed in 2002. Of the 21 schools, 57 
percent indicated they were not satisfied with the formal mathematics education training of their 
faculty candidates.  

         The survey found that community colleges want future faculty members who had 
knowledge of various teaching styles and could teach to a diverse student population. The 
colleges also want professors with knowledge of reform strategies, ways in which to teach 
rigorous mathematics, as well as classroom management and communication skills, Shabell says. 

         Using the feedback from the survey, mathematics faculty developed the program's 
course outline. Five new courses have been developed, and a sixth course is being revised to fit 
the program. One course was offered this fall and another will be offered in the winter quarter. 

         "We are really looking forward to our first graduating class in this emphasis," Shabell 
says. "We are eager to see the impact these graduates have in the profession."

        POMONA, Calif.  Fresh from her appointment as 2007 Rose Queen, Mary 
McCluggage and the six princesses of the Tournament of Roses Royal Court will visit the Cal 
Poly Pomona campus community on Thursday, Nov. 16, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. This visit allows 
the 2007 Royal Court to learn more about the long-standing Cal Poly Universities Rose Float 
tradition as well as meet Rose Float students, university administrators, faculty and staff.  

        The event begins at 11 a.m. with a luncheon at The Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch, where 
each court member will share their backgrounds, personal experiences in the selection process 
and involvement with the Tournament of Roses. In addition, Rose Float Club and Committee 
members will give an entertaining history of the Cal Poly float project and highlight new 
developments in the current years float plans.  

        Rose Queen Mary is an 18-year-old senior at Flintridge Preparatory School. The 2007 
princesses are: Christina Barsamian, 17, Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy; Aneesah Giroux, 17, 
John Marshall Fundamental High School; Sue Park, 16 (17 on 11/27/2006), La Canada High 
School; Blair Ramirez, 17, La Salle High School; Kaitlin Terpstra-Sweeney, 18, Pasadena City 
College and Danielle Vine, 17, Pasadena High School. Rose Queen, Mary McCluggage, 18, is a

surroundings by hosting a Hawaiian-themed party. The float entry was designed to suit the 
Pasadena Tournament of Roses 2007 theme, Our Good Nature.  In considering the parade 
theme, the students wanted to create a float that would also celebrate their love of fun.  

        About two dozen students from Cal Poly Pomona and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo work on 
the Rose Float year round. The two campuses, located approximately 225 miles apart, manage to 
coordinate the effort to complete the float for each parade. Throughout the 12-month period, both 
student committees work closely together on the design and construction of their respective 
portion to ensure the float is built to specification.  

        Students from the two universities have designed, constructed, decorated and financed 
entries to the Tournament of Roses Parade every year since 1949. Involvement in this project 
highlights the Cal Poly Universities learn-by-doing philosophy as students develop these 
decorative floats from design conception to welding together steel and pasting petals to driving 
the contraption down Colorado Boulevard. 

        Media representatives are welcome to attend the luncheon and tour the Rose Float Lab.

          PHILANTHROPIST JEAN KELLOGG GIVES $1.4 MILLION TO CAL POLY POMONA; 
                         CAL POLY POMONA HONORS PROGRAM RENAMED  
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Cal Poly Pomonas Honors Program was renamed Nov. 2 to 
recognize a generous $1 million endowment from philanthropist Jean Kellogg. The academic 
program for ambitious, goal-oriented students is now the Keith & Jean Kellogg Honors College.  
         Mrs. Kellogg and her late husband W. Keith Kellogg II have been longtime supporters of 
Cal Poly Pomona. After Mr. Kelloggs death in September 2005 at age 98, Mrs. Kellogg donated 
about $1.4 million from the W. Keith Kellogg II Trust to the university. Most of which was set 
aside to establish the Honors College endowment. 
         The donation also sets aside $250,000 for the University Art Gallery; $50,000 for the 
Ronald Simons Rose Float Endowment; and $146,534 was added to the Presidents Council 
Endowment. 
         This is not the first gift from Jean and Keith Kellogg, university President Ortiz said at 
the dedication ceremony for the college. Many students have gone on to finish their degrees 
because of the Kelloggs financial support. 
         W. Keith Kellogg II is the namesake and grandson of cereal magnate W.K. Kellogg, one 
of the universitys primary founders. A gift of 825 acres in 1949 by W.K. Kellogg eventually led 
to what is now Cal Poly Pomona.  
         Aside from sharing a name, the younger Kellogg also became a major benefactor of the 
university. He and his wife have contributed generously to the university over the years, 
including a key gift to support the University Art Gallery. The gallery was named in their honor 
in 1992.  
         The Kelloggs have also assiswted the Presidents Council Scholars program, which was 
previously funded through annual contributions to the Presidents Council. Thanks to the

impetus of their gifts, these scholarships are now supported by individual or family donations 
and have established a significant endowment fund. 
       Established in 2003, the honors program is designed for ambitious, goal-oriented students 
who love to learn and share ideas in a close-knit academic community. When the program first 
began it had about 60 students. Now there 270 students enrolled. 
        The Keith & Jean Kellogg Honors College provides opportunities for students to 
challenge themselves with more rigorous course material and to network with others who also 
seek such challenges. Students enrolled in the program experience smaller classes (about 20-25 
students), special mentoring relationships with faculty, summer research opportunities and 
involvement in community service. Additional advising is also provided to those students who 
wish to compete for national academic recognition and fellowships, such as Fulbright, Truman, 
Marshall and Rhodes scholarships. 
        The honors program has been a gateway for us to succeed, said Julia Cheng, a senior 
accounting major. 
        Matthew Troncale, a senior majoring in communications and President's Council 
Scholar, believes the honors program has helped him gain academic success because of the 
dedicated faculty, smaller class sizes and the tight community of students. 
        This is definitely an exciting moment for the honors students, he said during the 
ceremony. This critical funding gives the program more legitimacy and better standing in the 
academic community. 
        Sara Garver, who is a geography professor and interim director of the Keith and Jean 
Kellogg Honors College, said the endowment will help create more opportunities for students. 
She expects students to have more opportunities to research and travel to conferences to 
showcase their research. 
        In addition to their continuous support of Cal Poly Pomona, the Kelloggs have been 
longtime philanthropists in their community, having supported the Scripps Clinic & Research 
Foundation and most recently the CSU San Marcos Library. The facility, which opened in spring 
2004, was named the Kellogg Library thanks to their donation.

        POMONA, Calif.  Shabana Azmi is an award-

to work on their materials under the guidance of Solano and university students. The troupe 
writes, produces, and performs original plays about teen issues to hundreds of peers.  
        Theres a benefit for all the students involved, said Solano. The university students get 
a total immersion into youth-based, issue-based theatre. Theyre involved in a huge service-
learning project thats not just theoretical, but in the field. The high school students are given a 
lot of freedom to create a play about themselves and their issues. Thats very empowering 
because theyre involved from day one. These are issues they care about.  
        Many of the students in Peer Theatre come from difficult backgrounds and use theatre as 
a method to express themselves. The youths write plays based on their own experiences and 
include difficult subjects like incest, date-rape, gang violence and suicide. 
        This years play, which has been in development since the beginning of the school year, 
will address abuse. By winter, rehearsals take place in preparation for performances in spring. 
The plays are premiered at the Peer Resources Summit, and then staged at the Cal Poly Pomona 
Downtown Center and in schools throughout the Pomona Unified School District.

                      TAX EXPERT SPOTLIGHTS NEW TAX LAW IN EFFECT  
                  THROUGH 2007 BENEFITING OLDER CHARITABLE GIVERS  
 
       STORY:        Around this time of year, savvy taxpayers look for ways to reduce their tax 
                bill before the end of the year. One great tax break is still widely unknown, but 
                scheduled to expire in 2007.  
                     People over 70-½ can take advantage of a new tax law effecting charitable 
                tax rollovers. Previously, quirks in the tax laws forced some donors to pay taxes 
                for making a charitable donation if they were using distributions from their 
                IRA, explains tax lawyer Dr. John Karayan, director of planned giving at Cal 
                Poly Pomona. For a limited time, these people can avoid being taxed on almost 
                all IRA distributions that go directly to qualified charities. 
                     Similarly, the new law is helpful to people receiving taxable Social Security 
                pensions, generous donors as well as high-income donors.  

      EXPERT:        For details on this tax break and other tax issues, contact Dr. John E. 
                Karayan, J.D., director of planned giving at Cal Poly Pomona. Karayan helps 
                donors leverage donations with tax benefits. He is a tax lawyer with a Big Four 
                CPA firm background. He has taught taxation for 15 years as a business 
                professor. He recently released his third book coauthored with USC professor 
                Charles Swenson called Strategic Business Tax Planning.

                POMONA RESIDENT AWARDED PRESTIGIOUS $13,000 FELLOWSHIP 
 Cal Poly Pomona Student Jason Selwitz Receives Assistance in Researching Water Treatment 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Cal Poly Pomona graduate student Jason Selwitz was recently 
awarded a Switzer Environmental Fellowship, a highly competitive award that provides a one-
year $13,000 cash award for graduate study as well as networking and leadership support.  
        Only the most active, committed and focused individuals successfully join the network of 
more than 380 fellows selected since 1986. 
        A Pomona resident, Selwitz is a masters student in regenerative studies. He is also 
president of the Green Team, a student environmental club that organizes the campuss Earth 
Day activities.  

          His research focuses on water treatment -- using freshwater microalgae and constructed 
wetland systems to improve sanitation, restore watershed quality and ensure access to clean 
supplies. His thesis work is being overseen by Charles Ritz (Mechanical Engineering), Stephen 
Lyon (Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies) and Hossein Ahmadzadeh (Chemistry). 

        Selwitz, who is also an assistant hall coordinator for University Housing Services, is the 
first regenerative studies student and the third Cal Poly Pomona student in recent years to receive 
the award.  

         The fellowship, sponsored by the Robert and Patricia Switzer Foundation, supports 
highly talented graduate students in New England and California whose studies aim to improve 
environmental quality and who demonstrate leadership in their field.   

         Prior to entering the MSRS program at the Lyle Center, Selwitz was a lead wilderness 
guide and counselor for adolescents struggling with behavioral and family issues.

        From 1998-2000, he served in the Peace Corps as a Protected Area Community 
Educator. While on the island of Palawan in the Philippines, Selwitz worked with several 
communities surrounding the Underground River National Park/UNESCO World Heritage site to 
develop a livelihood skills development program for out-of-school high school students. The 
program focused on growing vegetables to improve nutrition and environmental health.  

        Selwitz' long-term objective is to design community-based projects that synthesize 
renewable energy use and effective water treatment with the regeneration of ecosystems.

        POMONA, Calif.  Just before the holidays, Cal Poly Pomona architecture students and 
their instructor will help improve an impoverished village in Tijuana.  

        With no telephones, electricity or paved roads, the Pedregal community has no organized 
form of communication. Important information, such as community improvement projects, 
upcoming workshops and means for assistance were posted on scrap plywood or wood posts. 

        Cal Poly Pomona students have built community information centers for the residents, 
which they began installing Dec. 2-4. Called Info-Structures, six of the edifices should be 
completed by the weekend of Dec. 9-10. They will provide a central meeting place for residents 
as well as a means for sharing important information. 

        Architecture is a service profession, so its important for our students to get out there 
and get experience working with clients. In this case, theyre getting the experience while also 
helping people who really need it and really appreciate it, says assistant professor Irma 
Ramirez, the courses instructor.  

        Nineteen students from advanced architectural design classes (ARCH 401 and ARCH 
406) began working on the project this quarter. They have interviewed their clients, observed 
cultural trends, provided 20 designs for residents to decide from, and even built six structures. 
The installations are the final step, consisting of packing the structures (which are both foldable 
and portable), transporting them, laying foundations and then putting the Info-Structures in 
place.

        While collaborating with the Pedregal community, students also helped 50 community 
members create mosaic tiles, which will be incorporated into each Info-Structure. 

        Ramirez and her students are eager to see the Info-Structures completed and a part of  
Pedregal community. Aside from making communication easier for the residents, they also hope 
these Info-Structures become effective parts of the landscape and instill community pride.

       NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AWARDS CAL POLY POMONA $3.3 MILLION GRANT  
         Funding Helps University Recruit Talented Faculty in Sciences and Technology 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  The National Science Foundation has awarded Cal Poly Pomona a 
$3.3 million grant that will enable the university to strengthen its ability to recruit talented and 
diverse faculty in its science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs.   

         Cal Poly Pomona is among only 12 institutions in the country selected for one of the 
ADVANCE: Institutional Transformation Awards. The university will join a network of 
prestigious universities across the nation (including Cornell, Brown and Duke) to develop ways 
to build the strength of its educational programs in technology.    

         Under the direction of Barbara Hacker, associate dean of the College of Engineering, the 
grant will help launch a program titled "The Path to Leadership: Collaborative Institutional 
Change." This five-year effort will create recruitment, retention and professional development 
programs to help diverse faculty, including women, in STEM disciplines to advance to 
leadership positions.   

         "We need to find new ways to give faculty the support they need to advance 
professionally," Hacker says. 

         She further notes that the grant provides an exceptional opportunity to make a difference 
at Cal Poly Pomona, helping to recruit strong faculty, support the development of their careers 
and prepare them to be national leaders in STEM education.

force conducted focus groups to identify the needs of faculty in their career development.  

         "What makes this project so exciting and promising is that it really has the potential to 
make a difference since our grant activities directly address needs that were identified by the 
faculty," Hacker says.   

         For example, the grant will support activities to improve recruitment and search 
processes, develop partnerships with other universities as a way to develop future faculty, create 
a local employer network to assist finding spouses of new hires appropriate employment, provide 
leadership development opportunities for faculty as ADVANCE scholars, facilitate professional 
learning communities for faculty, provide resources to promote research and create a mentoring 
program for faculty exploring multiple paths to leadership. 

         "Cal Poly Pomona has been successful at attracting excellent science and math faculty," 
says Donald Straney, dean of the College of Science. "With the ADVANCE award, we will 
ensure the people we hire can achieve their full potential and create for our students a world-
class learning environment."    

         Given the National Science Foundation's expectation that universities consider changes 
to institutional policies and practices as a result of this work, key administrators joined the 
faculty task force and were involved in the project from its inception. These administrators will 
continue to play a key role in the implementation of the activities.   

         "Cal Poly Pomona already has an outstanding community of STEM faculty and the new 
grant will help us to retain these faculty and provide them with professional development 
opportunities that prepare them to serve as role models and leaders in the STEM disciplines," 
Provost Tomas Morales says. "I also believe that as a result of the activities of this grant, we will 
be in an even stronger position to attract exceptional faculty."

        POMONA, Calif.  To complete the Cal Poly 
Universities Tournament of Roses float each year, about 
800 to 1,000 community volunteers lend a hand in covering 
every inch of the float with natural materials, such as 
flowers, leaves, seeds or bark.

        Putting together a float takes a lot of work throughout the year, said Janetta McDowell, 
senior coordinator of the Rose Float. By the end of the year, its crunch time, and the students 
really appreciate help from the community.  

        Between Dec. 13-22, volunteers can help prepare the float at the Cal Poly Pomona Rose 
Float Lab before its move to Pasadena. Work includes painting the float and processing the 
decoration materials. Rose Float Lab hours are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.

        The horse center is situated on 38 acres of green pastures where dozens of purebred 
Arabian horses thrive. The center is deeply rooted in university heritage, seeing as when Kellogg 
donated his land in 1949 to the university, one of the provisions required that his Arabian horse 
shows continue. 
        The horse shows fall on the first Sunday of month, September through June.  Along with 
continuing the shows, the center is dedicated to breeding, education, outreach and research. The 
horse center is internationally recognized for its breeding and training programs. 
        Before the generous $3 million endowment, the center relied mostly on the sale of its 
horses and boarding program for all the upkeep needed to the barns, fences and other aspects of 
the horse center. 
        "This funding will be crucial to us," says Bill Hughes, the center's director. "This will 
help us do deferred maintenance and improve our facilities." 
        The $2 million allocation will go toward the construction of a 5,600-square-foot Arabian 
Horse library. The $2 million gift from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation will provide the impetus 
for a $5.7 million capital campaign designed to build the library. 
        Currently the W.K. Kellogg Arabian Horse Library stores its collection in a small room 
in one of Kellogg's original stables, which now make up Union Plaza.

       The library collects and preserves all types of Arabian horse information in multiple 
formats including, newspapers, magazines, art work, brochures, newsletters, videotapes, 
photographs, letters, manuscripts and reports. The collection is intended to be used as a research 
facility by the university and community at large.  
       "We have a lot of material that is in storage," says Michelle Moyer, the College of 
Agriculture's Director of Development. "The new library would provide a much nicer setting to 
display these items and help preserve the legacy of the horse center." 
       The new library would be built on the horse center's grounds. Throughout the year, 
roughly 35,000 people visit the horse center, so there will be a steady stream of people who 
would likely be interested in the library's materials, Hughes says. 
       "This way people can go to the library and look at all the historical materials and then 
walk a little bit further and see the live show," Hughes says.  
       The W.K. Kellogg Foundation is based in Battle Creek, Michigan. It was established in 
1930 "to help people help themselves through the practical application of knowledge and 
resources to improve their quality of life and that of future generations." To achieve the greatest 
impact, the Foundation targets its grants toward specific areas. These include: health; food 
systems and rural development; youth and education; and philanthropy and volunteerism. Within 
these areas, attention is given to exploring learning opportunities in leadership; information and 
communication technology; capitalizing on diversity; and social and economic community 
development.  
       Grants are concentrated in the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the 
southern African countries of Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, 
Swaziland and Zimbabwe.  
       For further information, please visit the Foundation's Web site at www.wkkf.org. The site 
offers: in-depth information about the Foundation's programming interests; information on the 
Foundation's grant application process; a database of current grant recipients; and access to 
publications which report on Foundation-funded projects.

                                Cal Poly Pomona Increases Focus on 
                        Hot Field Of Supply Chain and Logistics Technology 
                                  with Support from $315,000 Grant 
 
        POMONA, Calif.   The Cal Poly Pomona department of Technology and Operations 
Management will increase research and study in the rapidly growing supply chain and logistics 
technology industry thanks to a $315,000 gift from the Industry Manufacturers Council of the 
City of Industry and Kent R. Valley of Majestic Realty. 

        This seed money will provide an enhanced laboratory for hands-on teaching and applied 
research, and recruit and support faculty experts. 

        "Technology is changing the face of business," says Hassan Halati, chair of the TOM 
department. "The modern business student needs to be more informed about this emerging field." 

        Cal Poly Pomona is uniquely located at the heart of one of the busiest logistics hubs in 
the world. Outsourced production operations and manufacturing feed the flow of billions of 
dollars of raw material, components, parts and finished goods through the ports of Southern 
California and their distribution across the nation. Technological innovation, globalization and e-
commerce impact the strategies, operations and complexity of today's businesses and the skill set 
needed to properly manage the business supply chain.  

        Between 1990 and 2003, the transportation and logistics industry in Southern California 
gained nearly 73,000 new jobs, amounting to a 23 percent increase, according to the California 
Transportation and Logistics Institute. By 2030, 350,000 more jobs will be needed to maintain 
the flow of goods through the Southland.

        "Many of these positions will be technical, well-paid programming jobs," says professor 
Lynn Turner. "We want our students prepared for these jobs, and we want our faculty conducting 
research that will influence the future of this industry." 

        The Supply Chain & Logistics Technology Laboratory will increase students' exposure to 
cutting-edge and emerging developments in Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and related 
technologies.   

        RFID, the Internet (EPCglobal Network), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), global 
positioning, and global data synchronization technologies have intense impact on businesses. 
The lab will provide firsthand experience and demonstrate the inner workings of the EPCglobal 
Network and state-of-the art developments in supply chain management technology.   

        Students will learn the strategic implications of RFID mandates in commercial and 
government sectors; acquire firsthand knowledge of RFID technology applications (tags, readers, 
antennas, protocols) and engage in the practical study of end-to-end RFID solutions implemented 
for real-world application. 

        The lab will be implemented in two phases. Phase 1, scheduled for this quarter, is the 
installation of core RFID/EPC technology components for classroom use. The lab will be located 
on an interim basis in Building 6.   

        Phase 2, scheduled for the 2008 winter quarter, involves implementation of training, 
testing and evaluation services as part of a larger industry outreach effort. Services will target 
small- to medium-sized businesses (e.g., suppliers who are required by their larger customers to 
have RFID capability).

                            Performing Benefit at Cal Poly Pomona Feb. 2 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Hello, Carol!  

        Beloved Broadway legend Carol Channing will 
give a 90-minute performance at Cal Poly Pomona that 
will help raise funds to support the arts.  

        An Evening with Carol Channing is scheduled 
Friday, Feb. 2, in the University Theatre at 8 p.m.  

        With her distinctive voice and wide eyes, 
Channing is a well-recognized stage and screen star. She 
is best known for her work in two iconic roles: Dolly Gallagher Levi in Hello, Dolly and Lorelei 
Lee in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.  

        This is an amazing opportunity to see one of the all-time, great Broadway performers, 
said theatre department chair Bill Morse.  

        Proceeds from an Evening with Carol Channing will benefit a scholarship endowment at 
Cal Poly Pomona for students studying the arts. The show will open with short performances by 
musical theatre, voice and dance students. 

        We are so thrilled that a musical theater legend like Carol Channing has taken an 
interest in our students, said Lisa Nashua, director of development in the College of Letters,

development of creativity in students from all fields of study. 

       Morse credits his foray into theatre to Channing. He remembers watching her and the 
Broadway cast of Hello, Dolly in Los Angeles in the mid-1960s.  

       We were way up in the second mezzanine, but it didnt matter, he said. There was 
Carol Channing in all her power and glory. She could just grab the audience. All the emotions 
went through me from laughing to crying. At the end of the show there were six curtain calls 
with the audience on its feet clapping like crazy. I dont think Ive ever seen that many again. I 
remember thinking to myself that this is something I want to be a part of. Now Ive been in 
theatre for 35 years. 

       Cal Poly Pomona is located at 3801 W. Temple Ave. in Pomona. VIP concert seating and

                             Student-Run Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch  
                          Reopens for Winter Quarter at Cal Poly Pomona 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Cal Poly Pomonas Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch is open for the 
quarter, and each week features new manager's specials and ... new managers. 

         The RKR is one of the most public applications of the learn-by-doing philosophy at Cal 
Poly Pomona. Every week, two classes of about 30 students each -- under the advisement of 
professors -- run lunch and dinner at the fine-dining restaurant perched atop one of the 
universitys hills.  

        The Hospitality Management students are seniors and juniors who have spent the course 
of their education at Cal Poly Pomona preparing for this challenging class. The 12-unit restaurant 
management courses require students to rotate weekly through various positions in order to learn 
all aspects of a restaurant. So one week a student might be the reservations manager and a line 
cook the next week. 

        The faculty team includes Chef Ernie Briones, Lesley Butler, Barbara Jean Bruin and 
Chef Scott Rudolph. 

        It's a lab and they just have to get out there and do it. By Friday of each week it's a well-
oiled machine, Bruin says. But on Monday they have to start all over again, and it can be 
rough.  

        Each week for lunch and dinner, there is a new four-member student management team 
that must draft a business plan for the restaurant, which includes recipe cost analysis, a human 
resources management plan and more.  

                                                 more 

        We emulate a real restaurant so these students really get an idea of what it will be like 
once they graduate, says Chef Rudolph, who oversees the kitchen during lunch. 

        In addition to new faces and tasty new menu items, the student-run enterprise is the first 
of its kind to use OpenTable, a widely-used online reservation service. This quarter the RKR 
became the first restaurant at a university to use OpenTable.com. Reservations can be made at: 
http://www.rkr.csupomona.edu/reservations.htm or by calling          (909) 869-4700. 

        This quarter, lunch is served Monday through Friday until March 9. Dinner is served 
Thursday through Saturday until March 10. Menus can be found at 
http://www.rkr.csupomona.edu/. 

        The Collins School of Hospitality Management is the largest and oldest hospitality 
program in California offering a four-year degree. Ranked regularly among the top three 
undergraduate hospitality management programs in North America, more than 700 Collins 
School students receive a superior education in this state-of-the-art facility.

        POMONA, Calif.  Want a front row ticket to the 2008 Tournament of Roses Parade 
and prime seats for the Rose Bowl game? Submit an entry into the Cal Poly Universities 2008 
Rose Float concept contest.  
        The winning float concept will become the Cal Poly Universities 60       th
                                                                                     consecutive float 
in the Tournament of Roses Parade. Aside from having their float seen by millions around the 
world, the contest winner will also receive two tickets to the Rose Bowl and four tickets to the 
Tournament of Roses Parade on New Years Day in Pasadena. The winner may also choose to 
forego the tickets in exchange for a $1,000 cash prize. 
         Anyone may submit a design concept based on next years general parade theme, 
Passport to the Worlds Celebrations.  
        The contest is simple. Entries need only portray an idea for a float rather than a finished 
design. Submissions may be drawn, painted or even described through text. All entries will be 
judged by the merit of the idea rather than the quality of the drawing or description. Participants 
may submit multiple entries. All entries become property of Cal Poly Rose Float. 
        Contest entries must be received by Friday, Feb. 9, at 5 p.m. Organizers ask that 
contestants submit their concept with their name, address and phone number placed in a sealed 
envelope attached to the back of the entry. They may be mailed to: Cal Poly Pomona, Rose Float 
Committee, Building 26, Room 131, Float Concept Contest, 3801 West Temple Ave., Pomona,

Gandhi, will visit Cal Poly Pomona's Ahimsa Center on Feb. 2 and lead a dialogue titled A New 
Perspective on Gandhi for a New Century. 
        Rajmohan Gandhi is currently a visiting professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign's Program in South Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, and faculty director of Global 
Crossroads, a learning and living community at the University of Illinois. He is a jury member

        Ahimsa is a philosophy of revering all life and refraining from harm to any living thing. 
The Ahimsa Center, in the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences, is dedicated to 
interdisciplinary teaching and learning about nonviolence and its practical applications at various

                MENTORS AT METRO EXHIBIT IN PASADENA FEATURES WORK BY 
                            CAL POLY POMONA FACULTY AND STUDENTS 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Cal Poly Pomona's Art department and the Light Bringer Project 
have teamed up to showcase work by faculty and students at Metro Galley in Pasadena from  
Feb. 17 to March 10. 

         The exhibit, aptly named "Mentors at Metro," features work by 16 art and design faculty 
members alongside work by 16 handpicked students.  

         "One important goal of the Art department has been to help our students immerse 
themselves into the world of art and design," says Babette Mayor, professor and chair of the Art 
department. "This is an opportunity for us to share our talent while helping students gain 
valuable insight into a highly rigorous and competitive experience."  

         The exhibit marks the first time the Light Bringer Project, which is a nonprofit Pasadena-
based cultural arts organization, has partnered with a university art department.  

         "The Light Bringer Project is very excited about partnering with art educators," Mayor 
says. "Our collaboration is important because it will set the standard."  

         The Light Bringer Project was founded in 1990 by residents who became interested in 
the role the arts, architecture and design have played in the growth and development of their 
community. They soon became a producer of visual, performing and literary arts programs that 
have highlighted creative voices from all sectors of the community. Partnerships began to unfold 
in which artists, arts educators and other creative professionals worked in tandem with human 
service organizations on specific projects and initiatives.

Marcos art is that on the one hand its something everyone can connect to because a lot of the 
scenes are everyday life. On the other hand, what make them special are the colors he uses and 
the unique lens he uses to see this everyday life, said Cybele Garcia, coordinator of the Cal Poly 
Pomona Downtown Center.  

        A free opening reception with the artist will be Saturday, March 10, from 6 p.m. to 9 
p.m. A graphic artist by day, Zamora will also provide live screen printings during the reception.

                      SUBCONTRACTOR INJURED AT CAL POLY POMONA  
 

        POMONA, Calif.  A subcontractor was seriously injured while performing repair work 
on an electrical substation at Cal Poly Pomona on Tuesday, Feb. 20, at 4 p.m. 

        Power was interrupted throughout several buildings at Cal Poly Pomona after the 
incident. Due to the power outage, evening classes were cancelled for Feb. 20 in the following 
buildings: 4, 7, 24, 66 and 79.  

         Medic One, the Los Angeles County Fire Department and the University Police 
Department immediately responded to the incident, which took place behind the universitys 
Bronco Bookstore.  

         The injured man is an employee of High Voltage Technical Services. He was taken to 
Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center in critical condition.

cause of the incident is under investigation. 

        No other information is available at this time.

                  BOOK SIGNING FOR KEITH SOON KIM AUTOBIOGRAPHY  
                              TO BE HELD AT CAL POLY POMONA  
                                                    
       POMONA, Calif.  From first generation Korean immigrant to Samsung Electronics 
executive, Keith Soon Kim has quite a story to tell in his autobiography PAR 50/70: 50 Years in 
America, 70 Years on Earth. 
       An alumnus of Cal Poly Pomona, Kim will have a book signing at the university on 
Monday, March 12, from ***noon to 2:30 p.m.*** in the Kellogg West Conference Centers 
Valley Vista Room. ***Each book is $20 or $15 for students.*** Proceeds from the event will 
benefit the College of Science at Cal Poly Pomona. 
       Born in Korea, Kim escaped the threat of communism and made his way to California. 
He received his degree in mathematics at Cal Poly Pomona in 1962 before forging a prestigious 
career in the electronics industry. His strong university connection began during his 
undergraduate years, leaving a lasting impression that has helped him understand the importance 
of supporting students as a donor today. 
       After completing the electronic engineering graduate program at UCLA, Kim began 
working as a digital computer design engineer for National Cash Register. Kim subsequently 
began a career spanning more than three decades with Xerox Corporation, advancing from 
project manager to manager of reliability. Just as he prepared for retirement, he was avidly 
recruited by Samsung Electronics Co. in Korea. Kim put off his retirement plans for another five 
years, joining Samsung as executive vice president of corporate quality. 
       Kim was named a Cal Poly Pomona Distinguished Alumnus in 2005. 
       Cal Poly Pomona is located at 3801 W. Temple Ave., Pomona. Kellogg West is nestled on 
the hills above the university off Center Circle Drive. For more information, call (909) 869-5070.

                             Organic Farm to Sprout at Cal Poly Pomona 
                                    Thanks to Student-Led Project 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  A student-run organic farm has begun to take root on roughly three 
acres of the Cal Poly Pomona campus. The student enterprise known as Pomona Organics had 
eager retailers lined up before its first seedlings began to sprout in February. 

        Lead by Agriculture students Patrick Dosier, 22, and Paul Nurre, 24, Pomona Organics is 
positioned to have a significant presence in the locally grown, sustainable farming produce 
market. 

        I have a lot of faith and confidence that they will pull it off, says Dan Hostetler, 
professor and chair of the Plant Sciences department at Cal Poly Pomona. This is an excellent 
project. 

        Pomona Organics, which is a Cal Poly Pomona Green Team student club initiative, is 
growing seasonal vegetables and fruit including a variety of tomatoes and melons, sweet corn 
and bell peppers.  The student group, which has about 15 active members, plans to sell its 
organic bounty at farmers markets in Irvine, Baldwin Park, Claremont and Pomona. Cal Poly 
Pomonas Farm Store at Kellogg Ranch and select restaurants on campus also plan to carry the 
produce this spring. 

        About a half of an acre of the farm is located on noncontiguous plots at the John T. Lyle 
Center for Regenerative Studies where specialty crops such as daikon radishes are grown.   

        The rest of the farm is located on about 2.4 acres of Spadra Ranch south of the main Cal 
Poly Pomona campus.  The acreage was home to a grapefruit orchard that had long been left to 
gather weeds. The white marsh style grapefruits fell out of favor in the 1970, and as time passed, 
the declining sales could not keep pace with the cost to pick the fruit.

        Hostetler arranged for the unruly overgrown property to be cleared during this past winter 
break enabling the students to get the field ready for planting. A lone wild pepper tree was left on 
the plot lending a new name and identity to the once-ignored property. 

        To the untrained eye, cultivating Pepper Tree Ranch looks like a huge undertaking for a 
student group. However, Dosier and Nurre, who have accrued work experience  on- and off-
campus and have gained a level of insight about plant and soil sciences from their coursework, 
will be able to manage the land, Hostetler said. 

        They are both ambitious, quality students, he said. Not every student can do what they 
are doing. 

         The College of Agriculture has data going back several years that show inorganic 
pesticides and other chemicals were not used on the property, so it can qualify to become 
certified by the California Certified Organic Farmers association. The same goes for the smaller 
plots at the Lyle Center, Dosier said. 

        Dosier has carefully arranged for all organic products such as seeds, moss and soil, to be 
used in the planting process. He also has several organic failsafe measures in place to deal with 
pesky insects. 

        Pomona Organics is a student enterprise project, which means the group has entered into 
crop share lease with the Cal Poly Pomona Foundation. A percentage of their crop sales are used 
to repay the Foundation and the College of Agriculture for expenses accrued getting the project 
started.  

        The goal is to become a small self-supporting business so Pomona Organics continues

                                Olympic Gold Medalist Billy Mills  
                     Shares his Inspirational Story at Cal Poly Pomona 
                                                      
        POMONA, Calif.  In 1964, track and field runner Billy Mills was a virtual unknown. 
With only 100 meters left in the 10,000-meter race, he pulled ahead of the competition, set an 
Olympic record and took home a gold medal. It was one of the greatest upsets in Olympic 
history. He became a household name and his story was captured in the movie Running Brave.  

        As a Native American runner, Mills phenomenal Olympic victory was even more 
amazing because he faced open hostility, racism and cultural barriers.  

        Mills will share his story, Your Gift from the Creator, on Tuesday, April 10, from 2 p.m. 
to 3 p.m. in the Cal Poly Pomona Bronco Student Centers Ursa Major Rooms. A reception, 
sponsored by the Native American Student Center, will immediately follow the lecture in the 
Union Plazas Rainbow Weaver Room (Building 26, Room 104). Mills will also meet with the 
Cal Poly Pomona track and field team. 

        Both the lecture and reception are free and open to the public. 

        His story is about overcoming challenges and the barriers of culture. It is a human story 
that is inspirational, and everyone will come away uplifted. said event host Charlene Teters, the 
Hugh O. La Bounty Chair of Interdisciplinary Applied Knowledge at the university. 

        Cal Poly Pomona is located at 3801 W. Temple Ave. in Pomona. Parking permits can be 
obtained for $5 at the Visitor Information Booth along Kellogg Drive. For more information, call

                      Local Math Professor Earns National Recognition  
                       for Mathematics Education at Cal Poly Pomona  
                                                     
        POMONA, Calif.        A West Covina resident and longtime Cal Poly Pomona math 
professor has been awarded the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Lifetime 
Achievement Medal. The recognition places professor Judith Jacobs among the upper echelons 
of math educators in the United States.  

        Jacobs, who is the director of the Center for Education and Equity in Mathematics, 
Science, and Technology (CEEMaST), recently received her award at the councils national 
conference in Atlanta, Ga. Also recognized at the event was Douglas A. Grouws of Columbia, 
Mo. Both were selected in recognition of a lifetime of accomplishments in leadership, teaching, 
and service to mathematics education. 

        This award places Judith in very select company of extraordinary math educators and 
national leaders in math education, says College of Science Dean Donald Straney. I think we 
all know how hard Judith works and how much she has contributed to math education in our 
area. It is a real pleasure to have that contribution recognized nationally by her peers. 

        Jacobs is the second math professor from Cal Poly Pomona to earn this top honor. 
Professor Emeritus Jack Price received the award a few years back. He also surprised Jacobs by 
nominating her for the award. 

        The self-described New York Jewish Liberal Feminist, has focused her research 
throughout the years exploring gender issues in mathematics. She searches for answers and 
solutions as to why fewer women study advanced mathematics and pursue careers in 
mathematics.

       Consistently women choose not to go on in mathematics and math-related courses, she 
says. It's much better now than in 1973 when I did my dissertation, but it still happens. 

       Jacobs, a native of Brooklyn, N.Y., began teaching junior high school and high school 
mathematics 43 years ago. 

       Jacobs direction to be a teacher of teachers was largely set in the summer of 1966, when 
she attended a National Science Foundation-funded six-week institute and met Robert B. Davis, 
the creator of The Madison Project.   

       Davis taught me more about myself as a mathematician and a mathematics teacher than 
I learned in all of my other experiences, she recalls. I became aware of why my students had 
trouble grasping mathematical concepts. Davis understood how to help students make sense of 
mathematics and helped me become a more skillful mathematics teacher. 

        After spending the first half of her career on the East Coast, Jacobs moved to California 
in 1986 to teach at Cal Poly Pomona.  

        Before someone can teach mathematics, they need to know mathematics. So I start 
there, she says. Mathematics has to make sense. It can't just be a set of rules you have to 
remember. 

        Through CEEMaST, an educational community service offered by the College of 
Science, Jacobs works with local school districts to develop and conduct professional 
development training for teachers.  

        In the past 20 years, Jacobs has been instrumental in bringing over $6 million in grants 
for Cal Poly Pomona programs and partnership programs with area school districts. 

        Jacobs says she is incredibly pleased to have her accomplishments acknowledged by 
such a prestigious award of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. 

        This award says what I've been doing my whole life has mattered and made a 
contribution to the education of all children, she says.

                        Ethics Conference Explores Marriage and Morals 
                                   at Cal Poly Pomona April 18-19  
 
        With news of gay marriage legalization and outlawed polygamist leaders making waves 
in the American media recently, Cal Poly Pomona will host a free ethics conference addressing 
Marriage and Morals from April 18-19. 

        Marriage and Morals will explore key issues surrounding marriage. Topics include the 
gay marriage debate; polygamy and democracy; family values; adultery; and marriage reform.  

        The 12 th
                  annual ethics conference is sponsored by Cal Poly Pomonas Philosophy 
Department, the Institute for Ethics & Public Policy, the Ethics Society, and the College of 
Letters, Arts & Social Sciences.  

         With all the hot button issues surrounding marriage at this time, the Philosophy 
Department thought this would be a particularly timely topic, said assistant philosophy 
professor Michael Cholbi. On the one hand you see surveys where more people believe in 
marriage and believe its an important institution. But at the same time more people are delaying 
marriage and cohabiting. It seems time to have a larger social conversation about marriage, its 
status in society and personal ethics, such as adultery.   

        All sessions are free and open to the public.  

        Most events are scheduled at Cal Poly Pomona, 3801 W. Temple Ave., in the CLA 
Building, 8 th
              floor Heritage Conference Room, except the Stephanie Coontz discussion at the 
Downtown Center, 300 W. Second St. in Downtown Pomona. Parking permits are required at 
Cal Poly Pomona, and can be purchased for $5 at the Visitor Information Booth along Kellogg

                        LITERACY ENCOURAGED THROUGH FAMILY FUN DAYS  
                             AT CAL POLY POMONA DOWNTOWN CENTER

literacy are encouraged to bring their families to Family Fun Days. This lively event occurs 

every fourth Saturday of the month from 1-4 p.m. at the Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center.   

        The Cal Poly Pomona Academy for Literacy through the Arts, headquartered at the

activities. Children receive a book at each Family Fun Days event to highlight this belief. 

        It offers an alternative activity for kids and their families, said Jonnie Owens, Family 

Fun Days founder and community outreach coordinator of the Downtown Center.  

        Owens added there is a need for more literacy programs because of the educational 

benefits it provides the community. Such programs help participants develop lifelong reading 

and writing skills.  

        Whether through story circles, puppet shows or workshops, Family Fun Days entertains 

individuals of all ages. Attendees participate in a variety of activities such as theatre games, 

improvisations and hands-on projects. Each activity corresponds to a specific learning theme 

selected for the month.

       CAL POLY POMONA NAMES ROBERT BALZER TO LEAD CAPITAL CAMPAIGN  
                         Local Newspaper Publisher and Philanthropist to  
                          Oversee Multi-Million Dollar Fundraising Effort 
                                                     
        POMONA, Calif.  Robert Balzer, who has served as the group publisher and chief 
executive officer of the San Bernardino Sun, the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin and Redlands 
Daily Facts since June 2004, has agreed to join Cal Poly Pomona as the new executive director 
of the universitys capital campaign. He will report to Scott Warrington, vice president of 
University Advancement, and lead the university through an ambitious multi-million dollar 
fundraising effort, effective July 1.  

        This is a great moment in my career as I now can direct 100 percent of my time on my 
true passion  education, said Balzer.  Cal Poly Pomona is an extraordinary university with a 
rich history. I look forward to supporting the great work of its faculty and staff by raising the 
resources needed to provide students with an unparalleled educational experience. 

        The capital campaign is expected to formally launch in the fall of 2008. This will be 
preceded by a feasibility study and a comprehensive review of the universitys primary funding 
and endowment needs. The executive director will lead that effort and serve as the senior 
leadership for all campaign-related matters. Capital campaigns usually require 5-7 years. The 
executive director position will end when the campaign goal is reached. 

         Acquiring someone like Bob Balzer is an extraordinary coup for Cal Poly Pomona, 
said President Michael Ortiz.  His reputation in the community is the result of his strong 
character and integrity. Bob will use those resources to bring an immediate impact to our 
development team, creating opportunities and access that will prove invaluable to the campaign.

                                  CAL POLY POMONA COMMITTED 
                               TO ACHIEVING CLIMATE NEUTRALITY 
                                                       
        Cal Poly Pomona is taking a stand on global warming, and it is starting so by addressing 

its own impact on the environment. A comprehensive plan is being developed to assess and 

reduce the university's greenhouse gas emissions in order to become climate neutral.  

              University President Michael Ortiz has joined more than 200 presidents and chancellors 

of colleges and universities across the country by pledging his support to the President's Climate 

Commitment Leadership Circle. This consortium of educational leaders aims to reduce the 

emission of greenhouse gases in an effort to ward off impacts of global warming.  

              Ortiz is one of three California State University presidents to sign this commitment. 

              "This commitment requires Cal Poly Pomona to develop a comprehensive plan of action 

that will lead to climate neutrality and increase the critical education and research necessary for 

society to re-stabilize the world's climate," Ortiz says. "The urgency for dealing with global 

warming is well documented." 

              To carry out the plan, Ortiz created the President's Climate Commitment Task Force, 

which includes individuals from each division and auxiliary on campus. The task force is co-

chaired by Ed Barnes, interim vice president for Administrative Affairs, and Kyle Brown, 

director, Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies.

       "Cal Poly Pomona is well positioned to complete this charge. For nearly 15 years, the 

Lyle Center has sparked research and education in environmental sustainability, which includes 

efforts to reduce the affects of global warming," Ortiz says. "There is also a strong desire by 

many on campus to increase the teachings of climate neutrality and sustainability in our 

curriculum and in other educational opportunities for students." 

              The task force will begin this process by completing a comprehensive inventory of the 

university's greenhouse gas emissions (including emissions from electricity, heating and 

commuting) and update the inventory every other year thereafter.   

              Within two years, this group is charged with developing an institutional plan for 

becoming climate neutral.  This will include a target date for achieving climate neutrality, 

interim targets for goals and actions that will lead to climate neutrality.  

              The plan will also include actions to make climate neutrality and sustainability a part of 

the curriculum and other educational experience for students, actions to expand research and 

other efforts necessary to achieve neutrality, and mechanisms for tracking progress on goals and 

actions. 

       The Task Force will be required to make the plan, inventory, and periodic progress 

reports publicly available by providing them to the Association for the Advancement of 

Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) for posting and dissemination.   

              "This is a daunting task, but one that must be addressed," Ortiz says.    

        While the task force is at work on the comprehensive plan, the campus must initiate 

two or more of the following actions to reduce greenhouse gases: 

   •   Establish a policy that all new campus construction will be built to meet at least the U.S. 
       Green Building Council's LEED Silver standard or equivalent

    •   Adopt an energy-efficient appliance purchasing policy requiring purchase of ENERGY 
        STAR certified products in all areas for which such ratings exist              

    •   Encourage use of, and provide access to, public transportation for all faculty, staff, 
        students and visitors              

    •   Within one year of signing the plan, begin purchasing or producing at least 15 percent of 
        the university's electricity consumption from renewable sources

                       RELAY FOR LIFE RETURNS TO CAL POLY POMONA                     

              For the second year in a row, walkers and runners will go around the clock in the battle 

against cancer during the American Cancer Society's Relay For Life of Pomona.  

        Teams from the Pomona community will gather at the university at 10 a.m. on May 19 

for a 24-hour relay against cancer. Relay For Life is a family-orientated team event where 

participants can walk or run relay-style around the track and take part in fun activities off the 

track. Teams can include co-workers, club members, family and friends who have gathered 

donations prior to the event.  

        Relay For Life will include live music, dancing and other activities. Parking will be 

available in lots C and D. 

        "Relay For Life is a unique opportunity for our community to come together in the fight 

against cancer," said student Alexa Lowery, event chair. "Many of the participants are cancer 

survivors, which serves as a reminder that our community is not immune to this disease and that 

we can actually help our friends, families and our neighbors who have been touched by cancer." 

        The public is invited to attend the luminaria ceremony, which will take place after 

sundown. To honor the community's cancer survivors and to commemorate those lost to the 

disease, survivors will circle the track rimmed with glowing luminarias while the names of 

survivors and those lost to the disease are read aloud. Luminarias can be purchased at the event.

        The Cal Poly Pomona American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Concrete Canoe 

Team will make a splash at the 20    th
                                       annual ASCE National Concrete Canoe Competition in 

Seattle from June 14-16. This year, the university earned a spot in the prestigious contest after 

finishing second in the Pacific Southwest Regional held on April 12-14.  

        Each spring, engineering students compete in the challenging event. Using concrete as 

their building material, the participants demonstrate their creativity and engineering skills.  

        Separated into four components, the competition includes an oral presentation, design 

paper, product evaluation and canoe race. Constructing the canoe is only half the battle for 

participants. In addition, each entry is evaluated based on its design, speed, floating ability and 

overall performance.  

        The concrete canoe competition is the most demanding and intense event at the ASCE 

regional conference, said Michael Thompson, Cal Poly Pomona concrete canoe team co-

captain. Success in the competition takes dedication, team work and determination. 

        More than 200 teams nationwide vie for a spot in the annual event, with only the top 

contenders in each conference qualifying for nationals. 

        In 2005, the Cal Poly Pomona team won the regional competition for the second year in a

               CAL POLY POMONA PRESENTS FACULTY FELLOWSHIP SEMINARS ON  
                              HIGH DESERT AGRICULTURE & BIODIESEL  
                                                      
        Members of the surrounding communities are invited to attend the annual John T. Lyle 

Center for Regenerative Studies Faculty Fellowship Seminars on May 24 and 31 from noon-1 

p.m. at the universitys College of Environmental Design Gallery. Entrance is free. 

        The seminars will discuss biodiesel innovations by Hossein Ahmadzadeh on May 24 and 

regional agricultural research by Jon Phillips on May 31. 

        For nearly five months, Phillips has assessed the feasibility of high-value agricultural 

production within San Bernardino Countys High Desert, particularly along the Cajon Pass near 

Silverwood Lake. 

        Inland Empire communities are experiencing significant urban development pressure. 

However, Phillips has found that alternative uses, such as agricultural production may be 

possible. Particularly high-value crop production, such as certified organic products and 

biodynamic production could take root in the desert areas. 

        The study evaluates agro-ecological resources, labor supply, institutional and physical 

infrastructure, access to markets and supporting industries and capital resources. Special 

attention is also paid to the infrastructure for marketing produce locally through roadside stands, 

farmers markets and community supported agriculture.

        The study will provide local residents with the opportunity to start or expand an 

agricultural enterprise, said Phillips. 

        On May 24, university chemist Hossein Ahmadzadeh will share his expertise about 

 biodiesel production. The seminar will cover the topic of fatty acid analysis in biodiesel fuel, a 

 common alternative to petroleum-based diesel. 

        Ahmadzadeh has developed two analysis techniques called High Performance Liquid 

 Chromatography and Capillary Electrophoresis. If successful, these innovations in testing may 

 allow for expansion of high-quality biodiesel production. 

        In 2004, Cal Poly Pomonas John T. Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies created the 

fellowship program to highlight the research of university faculty members.  

        The program fosters the research component of the centers mission, which is to 

advance the understanding of environmental sustainability, said Kyle Brown, program founder 

and director of the John T. Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies.

            ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS PARTICIPATE IN ROBOTICS RALLY 
       Event aims to inspire children to enjoy science and technology education 
                                                        
        POMONA, Calif.  On Tuesday, May 29, about 70 fourth and fifth graders from 
Kingsley Elementary School in Pomona and Collegewood Elementary School in Walnut will 
visit Cal Poly Pomona to participate in a Robotics Rally. 

        The elementary school students made their own robots using LEGOs ® as their primary 
building material. Their mechanical creations will compete in a series of challenges on the 
Engineering Meadow from 11 a.m. until 12:30 p.m. 

        For about four months, 10 Cal Poly Pomona students and three professors, Cesar Larriva                 
(Education), Mariappan "Jawa" Jawaharlal (Mechanical Engineering), and Jill Nemiro 
(Psychology and Sociology) have been working with the elementary school groups to enhance 
their education of robotics.  

        The objective of this outreach is to inspire young minds early on so they are excited about 
science and technology. These young children are now taking part in some challenges that are 
usually performed at high school/college level.

commencement ceremonies June 8 - 10. 
        The university holds eight different ceremonies representing each of its colleges and 
schools over a three-day span. All ceremonies will take place in the University Quad, adjacent to 
the Campus Center Marketplace (Building 97). 
        Cal Poly Pomona is proud of its graduates. Below you find stories about three 
exceptional students and Class of 56 alumnus Stuart Sperber, who will receive an honorary 
degree of Doctor of Science for his notable career and steadfast dedication to the university. 
Erik Espinoza, 22, of Los Angeles 
        Political science major Erik Espinoza, a former foster care youth, who, upon graduation, 
will join the distinguished Coro Fellows Program, a nine-month program that has trained the 
likes of Sen. Diane Feinstein and Virginia Governor Tim Kaine. 
         The Coro Fellowship is more than a networking opportunity, said Espinozas adviser 
David Speak, a political science professor. Its a years worth of training with contacts that will 
radically alter the opportunities available to him. 
        Espinoza entered the foster care system when he was 14. Emancipated foster youths often 
lack support and assistance once they leave the system at 18. Now 22, Espinoza credits Cal Poly 
Pomonas Renaissance Scholars program with guiding him through the university.  
        Its awesome. Its helped me tremendously and got me through when I was down, he 
said. When I didnt know what to do, what the next step was, what classes to take and how to 
choose a major -- things people take for granted -- they counseled me and showed me how not to 
get lost in this big college.

Rita Pruszynski, 62, of Glendora 
       Rita Pruszynski is Los Angeles County Office of Educations Special Education Teacher 
of the Year. She will gradate with a masters degree in special education after spending much of 
her adulthood believing she was not college material and that her role in life was to be a 
homemaker. At 50, she decided to go to college. 
       When I was growing up I was told that I didn't need an education, only job skills, 
because I would only stay home and take care of babies anyway, Pruszynski recalled. But for 
the 22 years that I stayed home and raised my five babies, those words haunted me  This is a 
dream I never dared to dream.  
Silvia Loera, 30, of Azusa 
       Liberal Studies major Silvia Loera graduates this June with a perfect 4.0 GPA even 
though English is her second language and she worked her way through college.  
       Loera immigrated to the United States from Mexico in 1995. She worked six days a week 
while attending night school to learn English and earn her high school diploma. In 1999, she 
enrolled at Citrus College where she earned all As. She transferred to Cal Poly Pomona in 2004 
where she continued to accrue perfect marks in her courses. Loera is a bilingual aide at a middle 
school in Azusa and plans to teach elementary school after earning her credential at Cal Poly 
Pomona. 
       Loera will be honored as valedictorian of the College of Education & Integrative Studies. 
Stuart Sperber, Class of 56, Honorary Degree of Doctor of Science 
              Stuart Sperber has created an impressive name for himself, his family and his company in 
the landscape, nursery and tree industries. As president and co-founder of Valley Crest Tree 
Company, Sperber has developed the largest containerized specimen tree growing operation in 
the United States. In addition, as vice president of Environmental Industries, he and his brother 
have created the largest landscape nursery maintenance and site development contracting firm in 
the country. 
              Sperbers support for his alma mater has been unyielding throughout the years. His 
company has helped university venues, such as AGRIscapes and the Japanese Garden, become 
some of the most beautiful and picturesque places in the region.

        This is a great design competition and will be an 
excellent showcase of student engineering professionalism, said Clifford Stover, faculty advisor 
for Cal Poly Pomonas Formula and Baja teams. This project, as well as our off-road SAE Baja 
project, is possible due to the Mechanical Engineering department's commitment to producing 
top-rate academic and practical hands-on engineers.  
        The demands for SAE Formula contests are rigorous and time consuming. Student teams 
must design, fabricate, and compete with small formula-style racecars. There are tight 
restrictions for car frames and engines, so students must be resourceful, creative and imaginative 
in order to vie for the top prizes. The design and fabrication process takes nearly a year. 
        This year, the Cal Poly Pomona team, which has about 20 active members, raised an 
unprecedented $60,000 in cash donations and $40,000 in material donations to finance the 
project, according to Jeremy Smith, a mechanical engineering student who is president of the Cal 
Poly Pomona SAE chapter and the team treasurer.

        In previous years, the team raised between $20,000 and $50,000. 
         This competition is important educationally, Smith said. Besides learning by doing 
and getting hands-on experience, we are also learning what we are good at professionally. 
        For more than 20 years, Cal Poly Pomonas team has revved its homemade engines 
earning the attention of industry scouts and leading the cumulative Formula SAE rankings in 
California.  
        Cal Poly Pomona received tenth and ninth place honors in 1995 and 1996, respectively, 
as well as the Spirit of Excellence Trophy. In 1998, the team placed a respectable top 25 finish. 
Cal Poly Pomona rebounded strongly in 2000 with a third place finish. In July 2000, the team 
became the first California school to participate in the Formula Student competition in England 
and took home the first place trophy.  
        This week, the Formula SAE teams will compete throughout the California Speedway, 
using the infield road course and paddock area, as well as the NASCAR garages. The suites 
above the hot pits will be used as a conference center for teams to make their sales and design 
presentations.  
        Professional engineers and racers score the entries at the competition. Points are awarded 
in categories such as engineering design, cost analysis, oral marketing presentation and high-
performance dynamic track events including acceleration, skid pad, autocross and endurance.

                       CAL POLY POMONA AWARDED BIG READ GRANT  
                University, Community Groups Join Together To Support Reading 
 
POMONA, Calif.  The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) has announced Pomona is 
one of 117 communities selected for the Big Read. 
        The Big Read, which launched nationally in October 2006 by the NEA in partnership 
with the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and Arts Midwest, encourages 
literary reading by asking communities to come together to read and discuss one book. 
        Pomonas Big Read will take place from Oct. 13 through Dec. 1 and will feature Bless 
Me, Ultima, by Rudolfo Anaya. 
        The National Endowment for the Arts has given us a wonderful opportunity to support 
the reading of literature and unite people in our community, said Jonnie Owens, community 
relations program director for the College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences, who will oversee 
the use of the grant. By reading one book and participating in a variety of creative, cultural and 
fun events together, we can accomplish great things in the city. 
         Bless Me, Ultima, is one of the most respected works of Chicano literature. Anaya tells 
the story of Antonio Luna Márez, a young boy who grapples with faith, identity and death as he 
comes of age in New Mexico. 
              I think many people in our community can relate on a cultural level, Owens said. 
However, this novel expresses universal themes; so regardless of ones ethnicity this is a book 
to cherish. We cant wait for people to start reading.   
        The NEA awarded Cal Poly Pomona $15,000 to carry-out a variety of community-based 
events this fall. Owens has already begun to work with the Pomona Unified School District, the 
Pomona Public Library, Historical Society of Pomona Valley, and with a variety of city officials 
and programs such as the Pomona Youth Advisory Committee, to brainstorm how each group

can participate. 
        Pomonas Big Read will include events aimed at readers and nonreaders alike such as 
read-a-thons, film screenings, book discussions, keynote addresses, performing arts 
presentations, and library and museum exhibits. 
       By joining the Big Read, these cities and towns are showing that reading is necessary to 
the cultural, civic, even economic fabric of their communities. They understand the benefit of 
having people from different generations and walks of life reading and discussing a great book, 
said NEA Chairman Dana Gioia. Yes, this is about reading, but it's also about getting people to 
leave their homes and offices, unplug themselves for a few hours, and enjoy the pleasures of 
literature with their neighbors. 
       Modeled on successful city reads programs, the Big Read is meant to address the 
national decline in literary reading as documented in the NEAs 2004 landmark survey Reading 
at Risk: A Survey of Literary Reading in America. The survey showed that less than half the 
American adult population now reads literature.  
       Communities participating in the Big Read this fall/winter will celebrate one of 12 classic 
American novels: Bless Me, Ultima by Rudolfo Anaya; Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury; My 
Ántonia by Willa Cather; The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald; The Maltese Falcon by 
Dashiell Hammett; A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway; Their Eyes Were Watching God 
by Zora Neale Hurston; To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee; The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter by 
Carson McCullers; The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck; The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan; or 
The Age of Innocence by Edith Wharton.

          DRAGON AND PHOENIX TO BE FEATURED IN CAL POLY UNIVERSITIES

                         60  ROSE FLOAT GUARDIANS OF HARMONY 
                                                      
        POMONA, Calif.  On New Year's Day, the watchful duo of a dragon and a phoenix 
will represent Cal Poly Universities in their 60th entry in the annual Tournament of Roses 
Parade.   

         "Guardians of Harmony," the winning entry chosen from a design contest in February, 
was rendered by Alejandro Angeles, a Cal Poly Pomona senior architecture major. Angeles, who 
hails from San Marcos, Calif., will receive a $1,000 cash prize for his idea. 

         In addition to the two mythological creatures, the float depicts traditional Chinese 
elements such as the Great Wall, a pagoda, cherry blossoms and carp. The float design is in line 
with "Passport to the World's Celebrations," the theme of the 119th Rose Parade. 

         "Cal Poly Pomona has a richness of diversity that is celebrated on campus and we 
wanted to celebrate this diversity by having a float that was reflective of our appreciation of 
cultural perspectives," said Janetta McDowell, senior coordinator of the Office of Student Life & 
Rose Float. "This float shows the many facets of the Chinese culture as well as the beauty of it 
all." 

         Angeles, who is originally from Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico, gained inspiration for the 
design from a vacation he took to China last summer.   

         "I wanted to contribute my ideas and see if an architecture student had a chance of 
winning this competition seeing how we usually do not have free time to do anything outside 
architecture," he said.

         Students from the Cal Poly Universities in Pomona and San Luis Obispo have designed, 
constructed, decorated and financed entries in the Tournament of Roses Parade every year since 
1949. Over the years, the floats have received 45 awards, including nine Founder's trophies for 
the best volunteer-built float. 

         The two campuses, located approximately 225 miles apart, manage to coordinate the 
effort to complete the float for each parade. Throughout a 12-month period, the student 
committees work closely together on their respective portions of the float to ensure it is built to 
specification.   

         Involvement in this project highlights the Cal Poly Universities' learn-by-doing 
philosophy as students develop these decorative floats from design conception to welding 
together steel and pasting petals to driving the contraption down Colorado Boulevard. 

         The San Luis Obispo team transports its half to Cal Poly Pomona where both teams 
collaborate to complete the project. Just before New Year's Day, the campus community joins 
the Rose Float team to help them put the finishing floral touches on the float before its debut on 
Colorado Boulevard.

                   CAL POLY POMONA MEETS SHIFT IN TEACHER TRENDS 
          Demand for Teachers in Elementary School Decreases, Special Education Up 
                                                     

        POMONA, Calif.  Shifts in the San Gabriel Valley and Inland Valley populations are 
causing changes in teacher education trends.  
        Changing student enrollments has led to a decrease in demand for elementary school 
teachers, while there is an increased need for special education teachers.  
         The trend is that elementary and secondary school enrollment is dropping, said Dr. 
Barbara Bromley, professor of education at Cal Poly Pomona. She attributes the population shifts 
to factors such as the aging of baby boomer children as well as the movement of families to 
lower-cost areas, such as eastern San Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
        With fewer children in the area at elementary age level, those education jobs have 
moved, Bromley said, noting declines in nearby Mountain View, Ontario-Montclair and Alta 
Loma school districts. However, there continues to be a need at all grade levels in special 
education as well as a need for high school teachers in math and science. 
        Cal Poly Pomona Department of Education faculty is encouraging elementary and 
secondary school teachers to consider working toward a special education credential. The special 
education credential prepares teachers with instructional strategies to help students with a variety 
of disabilities, such as learning disabilities, autism, intellectual disabilities, or emotional and 
behavioral problems.  
        Through the Intern Credential program, teachers can work in the classrooms while 
completing their credential.  
         Teachers are always surprised to find theyre only a few additional courses away from a 
special education credential and a whole other realm of teaching opportunities, Bromley said.  
        The credential program accepts applications for students each quarter. For more 
information about the special education credential or teaching credentials at Cal Poly Pomona, 
call Bromley at (909) 869-2326.

                  CAL POLY POMONA TO HOST ACE FELLOW KRISTEN DAY 
          UC Irvine Professor to Study Universitys Learn-by-Doing Approach 
                                                     
        POMONA, Calif.  Cal Poly Pomona will be hosting an American Council on 
Education Fellow for the 2007-2008 academic year. Through the fellowship, UC Irvine professor 
Kristen Day will be studying Cal Poly Pomonas learn-by-doing approach to education.  

        The ACE Fellows Program is the premier higher education leadership development 
program in the United States. It is designed to strengthen institutions and leadership in American 
higher education by identifying and preparing promising faculty and staff members. Fellows are 
included in the highest level of decision-making, participate in administrative activities and work 
on specific issues at the host organization.  

        Day has been a professor in the UC Irvine department of Planning, Policy and Design 
since 1994. Her research and teaching focus on issues of diversity and social justice in urban 
environments.  

        At Cal Poly Pomona, Day will work under the mentorship of Cal Poly Pomona president 
Michael Ortiz.  

        Day will be exploring the universitys learn-by-doing approach to education, which 
emphasizes the use of hands-on learning to bolster theoretical knowledge. These hands-on 
projects often involve community service projects, where students are given valuable learning 
experiences while providing much-needed assistance to the surrounding communities. 

        Im very excited about all the wonderful things going on at Cal Poly Pomona, and am 
delighted to have this opportunity to learn from faculty, staff, and students here, said Day, a 
resident of San Juan Capistrano.

        As director of the UCI Community Outreach Partnership Center, Day added that Cal Poly 
Pomonas service learning programs and learn-by-doing approach will help her develop new 
strategies for engaging faculty and students in successful community partnerships.  

        Dr. Marlene Ross, director of the Fellows Program, noted that most previous Fellows 
have advanced into major positions in academic administration. Of the more than 1,500 
participants in the first 42 years of the program, more than 300 have become chief executive 
officers and more than 1,100 have become provosts, vice presidents or deans. 

        Were extremely pleased with this class of Fellows, said Ross. The individuals 
selected have demonstrated strong leadership. The Fellows Program will sharpen and enhance 
their leadership skills and their network, and prepare them to address issues of concern to the 
higher education community. 

        Founded in 1918, ACE is the major coordinating body for all the nations higher 
education institutions, representing more than 1,600 college and university presidents, and more 
than 200 related associations, nationwide.

       Cal Poly Pomona President Michael Ortiz Honored with Vanguard Award 
                      for His Efforts to Prepare Hispanic Professionals  
                                                      
        POMONA, Calif.  A leading nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting 
outstanding Hispanic American professionals in science, technology, engineering and math 
(STEM) fields, will honor Cal Poly Pomona President Michael Ortiz with its first ever Vanguard 
Award. 

         The Vanguard Award is designed to honor an individual, with a non-technical 
background, who is actively involved in programs that recruit and prepare more Hispanic 
professionals for these technical fields. 

         "While this honor is directed to me, it is actually a reflection of the extraordinary work 
of our faculty and staff in the STEM disciplines," Ortiz said. "Their efforts are making a 
difference in the lives of our students and their families, opening doors for a new generation." 

         Ortiz will be honored at the 19th annual Hispanic Engineer National Achievement 
Awards Conference on Oct. 11 in San Diego.  

         Cal Poly Pomona has several programs in place that actively recruit and retain students 
and faculty in STEM fields.  

         In 2006, the National Science Foundation awarded the university a $3.3 million grant 
that will help launch a program titled "The Path to Leadership: Collaborative Institutional 
Change." This five-year effort will create recruitment, retention and professional development 
programs to help diverse faculty in STEM disciplines to advance to leadership positions. 

         The College of Engineering also has the distinction of graduating the largest number of

            Cal Poly Pomona Among the Best Public Universities in the West 
                                  in Americas Best Colleges 
                                                     
        POMONA, Calif.  Cal Poly Pomona continued to rank solidly in the newly released 
2008 edition of Americas Best Colleges by U.S. News & World Report.  

        The university ranked among the top universities in the West. Cal Poly Pomona tied for 
sixth with Cal State Chico in the category Top Public Universities  Masters in the Western 
United States. This ranking includes all public schools whose highest degrees are bachelor's and 
master's.  

        When compared with both public and private universities, in the category Best 
Universities  Masters, Cal Poly Pomona ranked 31      st
                                                            in the top tier of Western universities 
with undergraduate and masters programs.  

         The universitys College of Engineering was again singled out as exemplary. The college 
ranked 16 th
             in the nation on the list of Best Undergraduate Engineering Programs  Masters.  

         The universitys diverse mix of students from different racial and ethnic backgrounds 
was also acknowledged. According to U.S. Newss rankings formula, Cal Poly Pomona has a 
diversity index of 0.70, only 0.03 from the most diverse campuses in the nation. Cal Poly 
Pomona boasts the third most diverse student body in the Western United States under Racial 
Diversity Universities  Masters.  

        Cal Poly Pomona provides a quality education for a fraction of the cost of private 
universities. A California resident can attend Cal Poly Pomona for a full academic year for less 
than $4,000 each year.  

        The Americas Best Colleges rankings  which this year feature some substantial 
changes in methodology  will be published in the magazines Aug. 27 issue, on newsstands 
Monday, Aug. 20, and available online at www.usnews.com/colleges beginning today.

Catholic University in Hungary. In 1999, he was Senior Fulbright Lecturer/Scholar at the 
University of Tampere, Finland. 

        Moore is also known for his mentorship of students. He has advised the universitys 
National Model United Nations team since 1977, and built it into one of the strongest programs 
in the international competition. His teams have regularly garnered the coveted Outstanding 
Delegation and Outstanding Position Paper awards.  

        Throughout his career, he has been recognized by numerous groups. At Cal Poly Pomona 
honors have included the Distinguished Teacher Award, Outstanding Faculty Adviser Award, 
Outstanding International Scholar Award, and Outstanding Professor Award in the History 
Department; he was granted a Lifetime Achievement Award by the United Nations Association, 
and has won awards for papers given at professional conferences.  

         I am delighted that the university has decided to honor John Moore with the Hart 
Award, said Moores nominator, history associate professor Dr. Zuoyue Wang. It's not only a 
fitting recognition of John's outstanding contributions to our campus, but also a message to 
younger faculty members, and to the students, that it is both possible and highly fulfilling to live 
a life integrating learning, exploration, and community service. 

        The Hart Award was established in 1996 following the death of George P. Hart, a well-
respected 30-year member of the Political Science department and an associate dean in the 
College of Letters, Arts & Social Sciences. Hart had also served on the Academic Senate for 15 
years.

Ortiz will join Nobel laureates, distinguished thought leaders and 
decision makers from all around the world at the Festival of Thinkers,

        The biennial event focuses on fostering creativity at the 
scientific and social levels. 

        Many of the issues surrounding higher education and 
technology are bigger than our region, our state, and even our country, 
said President Ortiz. Im looking forward to taking part in these discussions with concerned 
citizens from all around the world.   

        The event will explore themes pertaining to protecting the environment; sustainable 
development; globalization and entrepreneurship; women and children of the world; health and 
wellness; the role of educators; poverty; and conflict. There will panel discussions and round-
tables on each theme. 

        According to organizers, nearly 25 Nobel laureates will attend the event along with 
leaders and intellectuals in a wide range of fields, including scientific research, philosophy and 
information technology. Participants include Werner Arber, 1978 Nobel Prize laureate for work 
that would lead to the development of recombinant DNA technology; Wangari Maathai, 2004 
Nobel Peace Prize recipient for her persistent struggle for democracy, human rights and 
environmental conservation; and Mortimer Zuckerman, editor in chief of US News and World 
Report.

                             OFFERS FAMILY-FRIENDLY ACTIVITIES 
                                                      
        POMONA, Calif.  The community is invited to celebrate the coming of fall at Cal Poly 
Pomonas popular Pumpkin Festival and Insect Fair, on Oct. 20 and 21. The two events family-
friendly activities easily pull in 20,000 people each year.  

                    PICK YOUR OWN PUMPKINS AT THE PUMPKIN FESTIVAL 

        Cal Poly Pomona will welcome thousands of people looking 
to pluck pumpkins from a patch during its 15th annual Pumpkin 
Festival on Oct. 20 and Oct. 21, from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m.  

         The annual harvest features family friendly activities 
including horse rides, a petting zoo, food, games and live 
entertainment. The largest attraction continues to be the local 
tradition of picking your own pumpkin straight out of the patch. 

        Student clubs from the College of Agriculture will sponsor a 
variety of food and game booths for a small fee. The fun features 
include a moon bouncer, a giant slide and face painting. Food and 
drink booths will offer a variety of refreshments including carne 
asada tacos, roasted corn on the cob and smoothies. 

         On Saturday, there will be a pancake breakfast ($5 adults, 
$3 kids), from 8 a.m. until 11 a.m. Admission to the Pumpkin 
Festival is free, and most pumpkins are $4 apiece.

        The Pumpkin Festival will be at the pumpkin patch near the Farm Store on Temple

                INSECT FAIR FEATURES A HALF MILLION CREEPY CRAWLERS 

       The Cal Poly Pomona Bronco Student Center will once 
again be swarming with creepy crawlers during the Insect Fair on 
Oct. 20 and Oct. 21, from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m. 
       Nearly a half million live insects and display insects from 
more than 20 exhibitors will be featured at the event sponsored 
annually by the Ag Bio Club.   
       "It really opens people's eyes," says Plant Sciences 
professor Richard Kaae. "Most of the exhibitors are collectors, so 
all these beautiful bugs from around the world, are the kind of 
stuff you never see. It's quite amazing."  
       Some of the features include an insect petting zoo, book and jewelry sales and the 
opportunity to taste some of the edible insects. 
       The insect fair will also hold Madagascar Hissing Cockroach races where participants 
may enter their own cockroach to race for 50 cents. 
       "People come back year after year because little kids are way into it," Kaae said. "They 
can buy bugs to put in their collections, like scorpions, giant millipedes that are longer than 12 
inches and tarantulas that people keep as pets." 
       Admission to the insect fair is $4 for adults and $3 for students and children 12 and 
under. Children two and under are admitted free.  
       Free shuttles will be available to transport participants from the Insect Fair to the 
concurrent Pumpkin Festival at the pumpkin patch.

                                    The Pomona Big Read 

       Pomona is one of 117 communities across the nation taking part in the National 
Endowment for the Arts program, which aims to promote reading across the country in response 
to studies that indicated United States residents were reading drastically less literature than in the 
past. 

        Pomona's Big Read will include events for readers and nonreaders alike such as read-a-
thons, film screenings, book discussions, contests, keynote addresses, performing arts 
presentations, and library and museum exhibits. Participants will receive free reading guides, and 
in some cases, free books. 

       Bless Me, Ultima is one of the most respected works of Chicano literature. Anaya tells 
the story of Antonio Luna Marez, a young boy who grapples with faith, identity and death as he 
comes of age in New Mexico. 

       "I think many people in our community can relate on a cultural level," said Jonnie 
Owens, community relations program director for the College of Letters, Arts & Social Sciences, 
who will oversee the use of the grant. "However, this novel expresses universal themes; so 
regardless of one's ethnicity this is a book to cherish. We can't wait for people to start reading."   

       Other events include a book signing and reception with Sam Quinones, author of True 
Tales of Another Mexico and Antonios Gun and Delfinos DreamTrue Tales of Mexican 
Migration. The event will be at 5 p.m. on Nov. 15 in the Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center. For 
a full listing of events, visit: www.class.csupomona.edu/downtowncenter/bigread/events.html.  

                                        The Big Read 

       The Big Read is an initiative of the National Endowment for the Arts in partnership with 
the Institute of Museum and Library Services and Arts Midwest. 

       Through a series of events over six weeks, event organizers hope to encourage literary 
reading by asking communities to come together to read and discuss one book. 

       The NEA awarded Cal Poly Pomona $15,000 to carry-out a variety of community-based 

                                          more 

events this fall. Owens worked with the Pomona Unified School District, the Pomona Public 
Library, Historical Society of Pomona Valley, and with a variety of city officials and programs 
such as the Pomona Youth Advisory Committee, to coordinate six weeks of literature inspired 
events. 

       "The National Endowment for the Arts has given us a wonderful opportunity to support 
the reading of literature and unite people in our community," said Owens. "By reading one book 
and participating in a variety of creative, cultural and fun events together, we can accomplish 
great things in the city." 

        Modeled on successful city reads programs, the Big Read is meant to address the 
national decline in literary reading as documented in the NEA's 2004 landmark survey Reading 
at Risk: A Survey of Literary Reading in America. The survey showed that less than half the 
American adult population now reads literature.  

       "By joining the Big Read, these cities and towns are showing that reading is necessary to 
the cultural, civic, even economic fabric of their communities. They understand the benefit of 
having people from different generations and walks of life reading and discussing a great book," 
said NEA Chairman Dana Gioia. "Yes, this is about reading, but it's also about getting people to 
leave their homes and offices, unplug themselves for a few hours, and enjoy the pleasures of

                       CAL POLY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION WINS AGAIN  
                                   AT STATEWIDE COMPETITION 
                                                     
        POMONA, Calif.  For the third consecutive year, the Cal Poly Federal Credit Union 
received first-place honors in the 2007 California Credit Union Leagues statewide Desjardins 
Youth Financial Education Awards program. 

        The awards program recognizes leadership by credit unions on behalf of youth financial 
literacy.  The Cal Poly Federal Credit Union received recognition in the asset category of less 
than $35 million at the state level. The state-level award allows the credit union to advance to the 
national Desjardins Youth Financial Education Awards, overseen by the Credit Union National 
Association. 

        The CPFCU regularly performs well at this competition. In 2005 and 2006, the credit 
union received the prestigious award at the state level and went on to earn top honors at the 
national level for their asset category. 

         [The Cal Poly Federal Credit Union] impressed the judges with their commitment to 
providing quality financial education programs to the young people in their respective 
communities, said Catherine Arra, California Credit Union League CU development project 
manager and administrator of the state Desjardins award competition. 

        The credit union plays an important role in educating Cal Poly Pomona students about 
managing their financial resources and providing them tools to make smart financial decisions. 
During the award period, the CPFCU reached more than 10,166 students through 61 workshops.  

        We believe financial literacy is crucial for youths, and are proud to offer services and 
workshops for the campus community, says Joy Tafarella, vice president of the Cal Poly

Federal Credit Union. We credit a strong relationship with groups throughout the university for 
this award. 

       The award is named in honor of Alphonse Desjardins, the founder of the North American 
credit union movement, who established the first "caisse populaire," or peoples bank, in Quebec 
in 1900. He helped establish the first American credit union in New Hampshire in 1909. 
Desjardins was an ardent believer in the value of teaching children to save, and he promoted the 
idea of in-school savings programs, or "caisses scolaires."

                 PROGRAM FOR UNDER-REPRESENTED, LOW-INCOME STUDENTS 
                                  RENEWED AT CAL POLY POMONA 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Cal Poly Pomona's McNair Scholars Program recently learned that 
it not only scored in the top 10 percent of programs nationally, but that its funding will also be 
renewed for another five years. Most grants are renewed for four-year periods. 

         The federal funding amounts to about $1.3 million over five years, according to Frank 
Torres, director of the program. 

         "This is a very prestigious award because so many universities who receive this funding 
are research-based institutions," Torres said. "We do a lot of research here at Cal Poly Pomona 
but not as much as other McNair institutions like UC Berkeley. This is quite a moral victory." 

         The McNair Scholars Program is a federally funded TRIO program that helps prepare 
students for doctoral study and careers in college teaching through a research internship. 

         McNair Scholars team with faculty members to conduct a variety of research projects. 
Their projects may vary greatly, but the scholars share a common bond working and supporting 
each other during the challenging three-quarter process. Each summer the students present their 
research projects at a symposium. 

         The university began the McNair Scholars Program during the 1999-2000 academic 
year. Four scholars have since earned doctoral degrees. They are Bridgette Cheeks, Shakira 
Ferguson, Sopheap Tang and Raffi Kaprielian. 

         The McNair Scholars Program is named for Ronald E. McNair, best known as one of the 
astronauts aboard the 1986 Challenger shuttle. Program staff members and faculty mentors

                  CAL POLY POMONA PROVIDES HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS  
                          A HANDS ON LOOK AT COMPUTER CAREERS 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Computer majors fresh out of college can expect to be some of the 
most sought after and well compensated candidates in the job market but somehow high school 
and community college students arent getting the message.  

        The Computer Information Systems (CIS) Department at Cal Poly Pomona will do its 
part to promote computing careers on Friday, Nov. 16, when Diamond Bar High School students 
will visit the university campus.  

        The teens will work on a hands-on computer forensics exercise that will have them 
nabbing a drug dealer by finding digital clues on the criminals computer. The students also will 
hear from professors and current students on the value of a computer-related major.  

        Although high-tech workers took a hit in the late 1990s, the industry has rebounded. Last 
year alone, the U.S. technology industry added 150,000 jobs, according to an American 
Electronics Association report. Also, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that five of the 
fastest growing jobs will be in the high technology between 2004 and 2014.  

        Still, the number of college students nationwide who are seeking a computing major has 
not reached the levels of the dot com boom.  

        The CIS Department is the oldest business-oriented programs in the country among 4-
year universities. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security named Cal Poly Pomona a 
National Center of Excellence in Information Assurance Education. Only four institutions in the 
state have received this honor.  

        The outreach event will be from 9:30 a.m. to noon in the CLA Building, C4-025.

                        NOTABLE AUTHOR AND JOURNALIST TAKES PART IN  
                                        POMONAS BIG READ 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Respected writer Sam Quinones will discuss his latest book 
Antonios Gun and Delfinos Dream (2007) and his reporting for the Los Angeles Times on the 
United StatesMexico border at a book signing taking place Thursday, Nov. 15, from 5-7 p.m. at 
the Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center.   
        Quinones also authored True Tales from another Mexico in 2001. 
        The book signing is part of Pomonas Big Read, taking place from Oct. 13 through Dec. 
1 and featuring the novel Bless Me, Ultima by Rudolfo Anaya.  
        The Big Read is an initiative of the National Endowment for the Arts in partnership with 
the Institute of Museum and Library Services and Arts Midwest. The National Endowment for 
the Arts awarded Cal Poly Pomona $15,000 to carry-out Big Read events over six weeks to 
encourage literary reading in the city of Pomona, one of 117 communities across the nation 
taking part in the program.  
        The Pomona Big Read includes various activities such as read-a-thons, film screenings, 
book discussions, contests, keynote addresses, performing arts presentations, and library and 
museum exhibits. Participants will have to opportunity to receive free reading guides, and in 
some cases, free books.  
        More than 7,500 people are expected to read the coming-of-age novel, says Jonnie 
Owens, community relations program director for the College of Letters, Arts & Social Sciences, 
who is overseeing the use of the grant. 
        The Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center is located at 300 W. Second St. in Pomonas

                    NSF GRANT BOLSTERS CYBER SECURITY EDUCATION 
                                      AT CAL POLY POMONA  
                                                     
        POMONA, Calif.  A $600,000 cyber security grant awarded to Cal Poly Pomona and a 
consortium of colleges could bolster the Southern California education system and workforce for 
years to come.  

        The universities and colleges participating in the grant aim to produce more graduates 
who specialize in cyber security, also known as information assurance. The two-year, National 
Science Foundation (NSF) grant will allow educators to enhance their curriculum, encourage 
students to study information assurance and promote cyber security studies to other colleges and 
universities in the state. The consortium plans to apply for a one-year extension that could boost 
the total grant amount to $900,000.  

        Not only has the U.S. Department of Homeland Security deemed this career path 
important for the country but the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that five of the 20 
fastest growing jobs between 2004 and 2014 will be in computing disciplines, including 
information assurance. Cal Poly Pomona graduates who have studied information assurance are 
working for law enforcement and district attorneys offices as well as private organizations such 
as PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst & Young.  

        The university is one of the most prepared institutions in the region to implement the 
NSF grant.  

        Cal Poly Pomona is currently the only institution in Southern California that has been 
named a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education by the 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said Dan Manson, interim chair of the Computer

        Other grant recipients in the consortium include Mt. San Antonio College, Cal State Los 
Angeles, Cal State Northridge and Long Beach City College. The NSF award is a renewal of a 
2003 grant given to Cal Poly Pomona and Mt. San Antonio College. The initial grant helped Cal 
Poly Pomona create a computer forensics lab and offer three additional courses in information 
assurance and security, said Manson who will oversee the universitys allotment of grant money.  

        Cal Poly Pomona will continue to spearhead the consortiums effort to encourage other 
universities and colleges to adopt information assurance programs. Manson and members of the 
CIS Department were instrumental in helping Cal State Sacramento become a National Center of 
Academic Excellence. They also have motivated Cal State Los Angeles and Cal State Chico to 
map out a program in information assurance.  

        Manson said he is thankful the grant will allow him to help more universities and 
colleges.  

        Information assurance education is not a zero sum game, Manson said. The more we 
help others the better we become.

                                     ETHICS BOWL COMPETITION 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Are payday loans an ethically responsible form of lending? Where, 
if anywhere, should intelligent design be taught in the public high school curriculum?  
        Watch students tackle some of societys most controversial issues in a battle of intellect 
and reasoning at the California Regional Ethics Bowl Competition taking place at Cal Poly 
Pomona on Dec. 1 from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.  
        Cal Poly Pomonas Philosophy Department is hosting the regional event, which includes 
teams from San Jose State, Cal State Bernardino, National Hispanic University and Weber State. 
The top-scoring teams will move onto the national Intercollegiate Ethics Bowl on Feb. 21, 2008 
in San Antonio, Texas. 
        In the Ethics Bowl, a moderator poses questions to teams of three to five students. These 
questions may involve ethical problems on wide-ranging topics such as differential 
undergraduate tuition, drug companies and FDA research, and the erosion of native art.  
        Unlike other competitions, the Ethics Bowl recognizes all answers. A panel of judges will 
evaluate answers using criteria based on intelligibility, focus on ethically relevant considerations, 
avoidance of ethical irrelevance and deliberative thoughtfulness. 
        For students, the Ethics Bowl is a rare opportunity to display their philosophical chops 
in public, says Philosophy professor Michael Cholbi. For observers, the Ethics Bowl gives 
them a chance to see how a liberal polytechnic produces ethically aware and socially 
conscientious individuals able to exercise leadership in their communities.  
        The event will be held at the Kellogg West Conference Center.         Admission is free. For

        POMONA, Calif.  As fall quarter 
final exams approach in December, Cal Poly 
students at Pomona and San Luis Obispo are 
thinking of another final stretch  completing 
their 60th consecutive entry into the 
Tournament of Roses Parade. 

        Its a tradition older than cell phones, 
personal computers and even some of the 
students grandparents. While the times may

change, the Cal Poly Universities are keeping          available online at www.csupomona.edu/news
their Rose Float tradition alive with their 2008 entry Guardians of Harmony. 

        The float depicts the watchful duo of a dragon and phoenix and other traditional Chinese 
elements such as the Great Wall, a pagoda, cherry blossoms and carp. The float design is in line 
with the theme of the 119th Rose Parade theme, Passport to the World's Celebrations.  

        Guardians of Harmony will be the 77      th

scheduled on Tuesday, Jan. 1, 2008 at 8 a.m. (PST). Those who watch the parade live will catch 
the student-built float during the last third of the parade.

perspectives, said Janetta McDowell, senior coordinator of the Office of Student Life & Rose 
Float. This float shows the many facets of the Chinese culture as well as the beauty of it all. 

        The Cal Poly Universities float program is one of the few self-built floats in the parade. 

        Students from the Cal Poly Universities in Pomona and San Luis Obispo have designed, 
constructed, decorated and financed entries in the Tournament of Roses Parade every year since 
1949. Over the years, the floats have received 45 awards, including nine Founder's trophies for 
the best volunteer-built float. 

         The two campuses, located approximately 225 miles apart, manage to coordinate the 
effort to complete the float for each parade. Throughout a 12-month period, the student 
committees work closely together on their respective portions of the float to ensure it is built to 
specification.   

         Involvement in this project highlights the Cal Poly Universities' learn-by-doing 
philosophy as students develop these decorative floats from design conception to welding 
together steel and pasting petals to driving the contraption down Colorado Boulevard. 

         The San Luis Obispo team transports its half to Cal Poly Pomona where both teams 
collaborate to complete the project. Just before New Year's Day, the campus community joins 
the Rose Float team to help them put the finishing floral touches on the float before its debut on 
Colorado Boulevard.

      Features Engineering Challenges, New Design Style and Range of Flowers 
                           
        POMONA, Calif.  To celebrate the 
Cal Poly Rose Floats diamond anniversary, 
students will present a float featuring a fresh 
new style and challenging engineering 
components.  

        The Cal Poly Universities have 
developed a reputation for inspiring laughs 
with humorous float designs. This years 60     th
                                                  
consecutive entry into the Tournament of

                                                                       Rose Float Guardians of Harmony 
Roses Parade will use traditional Chinese             available online at www.csupomona.edu/news
elements and a working waterfall in order to inspire wonder instead.  

        The 2008 float Guardians of Harmony features the watchful duo of a dragon and a 
phoenix. In addition to the two mythological creatures, the float depicts the Great Wall, a 
pagoda, cherry blossoms and carp. The float design is in line with Passport to the Worlds 
Celebrations, the theme of the 119th Rose Parade. 

        Its a big year, and for many of us its our last float as students. We decided were going 
to do everything we can to make sure its special. We wanted to branch out and challenge 
ourselves, said Matthew Yeseta, Rose Float chair at Cal Poly Pomona.  

        In addition to the fresh design style, students will also take their animation up a notch.

       The phoenix will sway from side to side with its wings outstretched emulating flight. 
Three carp will appear to jump from a pool of water fed by a three-tier waterfall pumped at 180 
gallons per minute. Students believe their biggest engineering feat will be using a new system to 
make the dragon appear to glide through the air. Using a complicated floating ring system to 
construct the dragon body, students hope audiences will notice the more lifelike effect the system 
has on the dragon body. 

       The decoration material for the float will feature a range of flowers, seeds and bark. Float 
watchers will also find split river cane, palm bark, orchids, poppy, Spanish moss, blue corn, 
sweet rice, flax seed, kumquat, kidney beans, cranberries, and orange slices throughout the float. 
The look of fur on the dragons head and body will be achieved with yellow and orange fire 
celosia, blended bird of paradise and ornamental pepper. Its claws will be lunaria. Other 
materials on the dragon include red anthurim, yellow strawflower, orange lentil and lemon peel. 
The phoenixs wings will be blended bird of paradise, yellow strawflower and red carnations. Its 
tail includes the use of red ginger flower, and its feathers will be accented with blue statice.  

       The Guardians of Harmony float concept was rendered by Alejandro Angeles, a Cal 
Poly Pomona senior architecture major. Angeles, who hails from San Marcos, Calif., won the 
annual float concept contest in February and received a $1,000 cash prize for his idea. Angeles 
gained inspiration for the design from a vacation he took to China last summer.   

       BACKGROUND 

        Students from the Cal Poly Universities in Pomona and San Luis Obispo have designed, 
constructed, decorated and financed entries in the Tournament of Roses Parade every year since 
1949. Over the years, the floats have received 45 awards, including nine Founder's trophies for 
the best volunteer-built float. 

        The two campuses, located approximately 225 miles apart, manage to coordinate the 
effort to complete the float for each parade. Throughout a 12-month period, the student 
committees work closely together on their respective portions of the float to ensure it is built to 
specification.

         Involvement in this project highlights the Cal Poly Universities' learn-by-doing 
philosophy as students develop these decorative floats from design conception to welding 
together steel and pasting petals to driving the contraption down Colorado Boulevard. 

        Late in the fall, the San Luis Obispo team transports its half to Cal Poly Pomona where 
both teams collaborate to complete the project. Just before New Year's Day, the campus 
community joins the Rose Float team to help them put the finishing floral touches on the float 
before its debut on Colorado Boulevard.

        POMONA, Calif.  Prominent scholars from around the country will converge at a free 
two-day conference to explore    Herbert Crolys Promise of American Life at its Centenary from 
Jan. 11 to 12 in the Cal Poly Pomona Bronco Student Centers England/Evans Room. 

        Herbert Croly was a political author whose book Promise of American Life had such a 
striking impact on 20 th
                         century America that President Theodore Roosevelt used its themes in his 
second presidential campaign in 1912. Crolys thoughts impacted twentieth century American 
politics, economic policy, social conditions, foreign affairs, journalism, and intellectual thought. 
His views were represented first by the New Deal, sanctioned by the Eisenhower era, and 
culminated in the New Frontier and the Great Society. 

        Croly may be the single most important thinker and writer to affect the modern, and 
novel, model of American liberalism, says conference chair and history professor emeritus John 
A. Moore.  

        The conference intends to bring together absolutely the very best scholars on the topic 
who will provide seminal presentations and engage in a spirited discussion; any observer who is 
intrigued by politics, public philosophies, and public policies in the 20  th
                                                                             and 21 st

including American foreign policy and economic policy, will find this conference highly 
enlightening. 

        The conference opens at 8:30 a.m. on Friday, Jan. 11, in the Bronco Student Centers 
England/Evans Room. Herbert Croly in History from at 9:30-11:30 a.m. includes presentations 
on The Intellectual Origins of Crolys Promise and Herbert Croly in the History of

                         Cal Poly Universities Seek Creative Float Ideas for  
                                 2009 Tournament of Roses Parade 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  If two heads are better than one, Cal Poly Rose Float students want 
to know what everyone in Southern California can come up with.  
        Cal Poly students in Pomona and San Luis Obispo are inviting the community to submit 
creative Rose Float ideas into their Design Concept Contest. The winning float concept will 
become the Cal Poly Universities 61    st
                                          consecutive float in the Tournament of Roses Parade.  
        Aside from having their float seen by millions around the world, the contest winner will 
also receive two tickets to the Rose Bowl and four tickets to the Tournament of Roses Parade on 
New Years Day in Pasadena. The winner may also choose to forego the tickets in exchange for 
a $1,000 cash prize. 
        The contest is simple. Anyone may submit a design concept based on next years general 
parade theme, Hats Off to Entertainment. Entries must convey a completed design for the 
float. Designs must be portrayed by a black and white sketch or color drawing and can be 
accompanied by a written description. All entries will be judged by the merit of the idea rather 
than the quality of the drawing or description. Participants may submit multiple entries. All 
entries become property of Cal Poly Rose Float. 
        Contest entries must be received by Friday, Feb. 8, at 5 p.m. Organizers ask that 
contestants submit their concept with their name, address and phone number placed in a sealed 
envelope attached to the back of the entry. Entries may be mailed to: Marla Franco, Cal Poly 
Rose Float, 3801 W. Temple Ave., Pomona, CA 91768.

                               NSF GRANT TO CAL POLY POMONA  
                          EXPLORES BARRIERS TO SUCCESS IN MATH 
                                                     
        POMONA, Calif.  Why are there fewer women and ethnic minorities represented in 
the math disciplines? Cal Poly Pomona has received a National Science Foundation grant that 
will explore that important question as the nation struggles to address the shortage of students 
entering the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).  

        Through a three-year grant of $449,993, Cal Poly Pomona psychology, sociology and 
math faculty will examine the way stereotypes may undermine girls and ethnic minorities 
interest and performance in math. Commonly held beliefs like boys are better at math than 
girls may impact a childs performance in math as well as affect their beliefs about themselves. 

        Expectations have a huge impact on youths, said Bettina Casad, an assistant professor 
of psychology and principal investigator of the grant. Through this research we want to go to 
the root of the issue. 

        Casad and co-principal investigators Faye Wachs and Patricia Hale have teamed with 
Pomona and Azusa Unified School Districts to work with 600 middle school students. Cal Poly 
Pomona students will also be involved as research assistants. 

        Researchers will focus on middle school children because girls science scores fall behind 
boys scores between fourth and eighth grade.  

        Something is happening in middle school that affects girls interests in STEM 
disciplines. This something continues to affect them in high school and college. By looking at 
sixth, seventh, and eighth graders, we are hoping to pinpoint when this effect is most 
pronounced, Casad said.

        Over the course of three years, researchers will examine the childrens attitudes as well as 
those of their parents, teachers, peer, counselors and community. At the end of the project, they 
hope to identify factors that help student success in math and factors that are barriers.  
        If we know what the barriers are, we can work on prevention, said Casad. If we know 
predictors to success, we can develop training for teachers to boost performance.

Cal Poly Pomonas Bronco Student Center in Ursa Major.  

        Drawing upon his personal experiences, Hilliard will address the values and challenges of 
collaborating across diverse communities. He encourages his audience to get involved, develop 
allies and create coalitions that embrace diversity and encourage social change.  

        This free lecture is hosted by the universitys Multicultural Council Quarterly and Black

pyramids of ancient Egypt. Fermented beer will serve as a liquid enzyme soil stabilizer. 

        A kick-off event introducing the campus to the unconventional project will be Friday, 
Feb. 8, from noon to 1 p.m. in Building 3, Lecture Hall 217. During the event, Clemmons will 
give her lecture Building Pyramids with Wind and Beer. The event is free and open to the 
public, though space is limited. 

        Clemmons theorizes the ancient Egyptians used wind as the motive force for building the 
pyramids, contrary to modern Egyptologists who believe the ancient buildings were erected 
through the heavy labor of thousands of workers. Her lecture includes an overview of Egyptian 
hieroglyphics that support her theory.

       Clemmons has been working on the theory since 1997 with a team of volunteers, 
including top engineers, scientists and academics. They found that erecting a 450 ton obelisk 
would require a 3,000-foot ramp and 6,500 laborers over several days. However, a properly 
employed kite method would take 16 workers, 8 kites, 48 pulleys, a 120-foot tower, and only 6 
hours.  

       They have erected obelisks and smaller pyramids. With each project they are slowly 
trying to downgrade the technology they use and increase the size or weight of their structure. 
Their work was the subject of National Geographic Expedition EC-Y02 and was profiled on the 
History Channel documentary Flying Pyramids, Soaring Stones.  

       I am excited about the prospect of working with the Cal Poly Pomona architecture 
students to construct a massive 106-ton true-pyramid said Clemmons, especially when the 
mission of Cal Poly is to augment didactic learning with actual hands-on experience. This 
hands-on philosophy is what enticed me to collaborate with this incredible school. 

       Associate professor of architecture Gary L. McGavin, AIA was introduced to the project 
through the Inland California chapter of the American Institute of Architects. This spring, about 
100 architecture students enrolled in McGavins Concrete and Masonry Structures classes will be 
involved in this latest hands-on project.  

       This class is generally about numbers, like the structural requirements of concrete mixes 
and the forces that can be put on them, he said. I think this type of project is the perfect way to 
get them to have some fun while theyre stealthily learning in what could be a dry class. This is 
the type of project theyll remember for their rest of their lives.  

       Students will be creating their own precast concrete through the sponsorship of the 
Precast/Prestressed Concrete Manufacturers Association of California.  

       By finals week, the students will have 53 stones ready to be flown into pyramid 
formation at the construction site on Quartz Hill near the Palmdale/Lancaster area.

        POMONA, Calif.  Cal Poly Pomona will take a different spin on Valentines Day by 
staging its eighth annual production of Eve Enslers Obie Award-winning play, The Vagina 
Monologues. 

        Cal Poly Pomona will present the benefit production on Feb. 9 from 7-9 p.m. in the 
Bronco Student Centers Ursa Major suite. In addition, a Spanish language production will be on 
Feb. 16 from 7-9 p.m.  

        Cal Poly Pomona is a part of the 2008 V-Day movement, where groups worldwide use 
Valentines Day to remind communities that love shouldnt hurt. The play is staged around the 
world in numerous languages to raise funds for and heighten awareness about ending violence 
against women and girls.  

        Proceeds from the universitys performances of The Vagina Monologues will go 
towards the Stop Violence Office and Cesar Chavez Center for Higher Education to create 
programs that address violence against women in diverse communities.  

        This years production will be dedicated to the memory of Monica Thomas-Harris, a 
local Upland resident with ties to the Cal Poly Pomona community. Thomas-Harris was 
kidnapped and murdered by her estranged husband, Curtis Bernard Harris, in January.  

        This wasnt one thing that happened to one person. Monicas story needs to be shared 
because its a reminder of the serious consequences of domestic violence, said Erika Zepeda, 
assistant coordinator of the Stop Violence Office. We need to take steps as a community to 
address these issues, whether its honoring her memory or serving as advocates against

        The Global Hawk model is based on the Block 10 configuration, which has a 116-foot 
wingspan. The next-generation configuration, the Block 20/30/40, boasts nearly a 131-foot 
wingspan and can carry 1,000 more pounds (up to 3,000 pounds) of internal payload and operate 
with two-and-a-half times the electrical power of the Block 10 version. Global Hawk UAVs can 
soar up to 65,000 feet, see through any type of weather at any time, and remain airborne for more 
than 30 hours on a single mission. UAVs provide warfighters with high-resolution, near real-
time imagery and other sensor data for intelligence, targeting and surveillance.  They can be 
controlled remotely from locations hundreds of miles away from the overflight area, without 
risking the life of pilots in conventional aircraft. 

        Northrop Grumman and its heritage companies have been in the UAV system business 
for more than 60 years, providing more than 100,000 unmanned systems to military customers in 
the United States and abroad.

showcases the variety of learning taking place at the university. Nearly 70 exhibits featuring

performances, multimedia presentations and other ways to demonstrate successful learning at Cal 
Poly Pomona. 
         "It's our hope that when people come to this event, they see the vibrant and diverse

                  CAL POLY POMONA FORUM EXPLORES THE HISTORY OF  
                        ENVIRONMENTALISM AND ITS IMPACT TODAY                   
                                                     
        POMONA, Calif.  Environmentalism started far before talk of global warming, 
biodiesel and going green. The movements intriguing history will be discussed during a free 
Campus Forum at Cal Poly Pomona on Wednesday, March 5, from noon-1 p.m. in the Bronco 
Student Centers Centaurus Room. 

        At the Campus Forum, professor Char Miller will discuss The Greatest Good: 100 Years 
of Conservation in America. Miller will probe the complex beginning of conservationism in the 
United States: Why did some people in the late nineteenth century conclude that the ravages of 
industrialization should be restrained? What tactics did they choose and why? What has been the 
impact of their ideas and activism over time? Using maps, photographs and cartoons, Miller will 
explore these and other questions to help us better understand these historical controversies and 
their relation to contemporary environmental dilemmas. 

        Following the lecture, a book signing will take place from 3:15 p.m. to 3:45 p.m. at the 
Bronco Bookstore. Copies of Millers books will be available for sale. 

        Miller is a history professor from Trinity University who specializes in American 
environmental and urban history, and has authored an extensive collection of books including 
Ground Work: Conservation in American Environmental Culture. He was named a 
Distinguished Leader for the Organization of American Historians and was recognized as a Piper 
Professor for teaching in Excellence in 2002. Miller is a Senior Fellow of the Pinchot Institute 
for Conservation, a contributing writer of the Texas Observer and the associate editor of 
Environmental History and the Journal of Forestry.

                          CAL POLY POMONA TOP 4 IN THE NATION AT  
                     THE INTERCOLLEGIATE ETHICS BOWL COMPETITION                      
                                                      
        POMONA, Calif.  A team from Cal Poly Pomona reached the semifinals and placed in 

the top four at the national Intercollegiate Ethics Bowl Competition held Thursday, Feb. 21, in 

San Antonio, Texas.  

              The Cal Poly Pomona Ethics Bowl team engaged in the ultimate test of reasoning by 

addressing a wide range of issues such as direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising and the 

distribution of photographs via Google Street View.  

              The Cal Poly Pomona team -- consisting of John Balla, Melinda Carrido, Cion 

Villalobos, Ara Astourian and Jennifer Cryer -- qualified for the national competition after 

winning the California Regional Ethics Bowl Competition in December. Nearly 150 colleges and 

universities across the nation competed, but only 32 qualified for the annual national 

competition.  

              At the national competition, the Cal Poly Pomona team swept through its preliminary 

matches, defeating Western Michigan University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel 

Hill and the University of Kentucky.  

              The team then dominated a very well-prepared team from DePauw University during its 

quarterfinal match. The teams streak of nine consecutive match wins came to an end during the

semifinal match against Wright State University, a university with multiple national titles. 

              For our team to reach the national semifinals is an extraordinary achievement, said the 

teams coach, philosophy professor Michael Cholbi. To be in the top four in the country after 

only three years of fielding an Ethics Bowl team at Cal Poly Pomona is astonishing. 

              In the Intercollegiate Ethics Bowl, a moderator poses questions to teams of three to five 

students. Each team receives a set of case studies in advance of the competition, and questions 

posed to teams at the competition are taken from that set. A panel of judges evaluated answers 

based on intelligibility, focus on ethically relevant considerations, avoidance of ethical 

irrelevance and deliberative thoughtfulness.

some serious material and may not be appropriate for children. 

        This event is a part of the universitys series of events in March celebrating Womens

                           Cal Poly Pomona Launches Connect-ED 
                                     Emergency Alert System 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Nearly one year ago, Virginia Tech University experienced the 
unthinkable when a gunman killed 32 people and himself in the bloodiest day in U.S. education 
history. Northern Illinois experienced its own tragedy recently with seven deaths at the hands of 
a campus shooter. These tragedies have brought focus to how a university communicates with its 
community during an emergency.  

         In an effort to embrace widely-used technology to benefit public safety, Cal Poly 
Pomona is launching a comprehensive emergency communications system that will alert 
members of the university community in the event of an urgent situation.  

        While there will always be some gap of time between when an incident occurs and when 
messages are delivered to the public, this technology assures that process is as quick as possible. 

         This system, contracted by Connect-ED, will be able to send messages 24 hours a day/7 
days a week. Messages can be sent to all home, office and cell phones, e-mail addresses, 
text/SMS, TTY/TTD devices and PDAs in a matter of minutes. Even if the region is hit with a 
catastrophic event, messages can be delivered through the system.  

         Maintaining a safe campus environment requires participation from everyone, and the 
university is strongly encouraging all students, staff and faculty to update their contact 
information. 

        The Office of Public Affairs will have primary responsibility for when and how messages 
will be delivered. University Police will have the ability to initiate these messages after hours. 

        For more information about Cal Poly Pomonas new emergency alert system, contact 
Uyen Mai in the Office of Public Affairs at (909) 869-5331 or utmai@csupomona.edu.

                         Cal Poly Pomona Hosts Annual Spring Rodeo 
                       at Glen Helen Regional Park in San Bernardino 
 

        POMONA, Calif.  The Cal Poly Pomona Rodeo Club is inviting the community to get 
out their cowboy hats and Wrangler Jeans for two enjoyable dusty days at the annual Spring 
Rodeo on March 14 and March 15 at Glen Helen Regional Park in San Bernardino.  

         Cal Poly Pomona will host nine additional colleges in the National Intercollegiate Rodeo 
Association (NIRA) sanctioned regional rodeo. Attendees will have the opportunity to watch 
these college students in action during events such as bull riding, barrel racing, roping, steer 
wrestling and goat tying.  

         When you get on the back of a bucking horse it's such an adrenalin rush, says Rob 
Oakleaf, president of the university's Rodeo Club and avid rodeo enthusiast. People sometimes 
don't realize the effort that goes into preparing for an event. You really have to work with the 
horse, and you both have to be at the top of your ability in competitions like this. 

         Re-established in 1994, the Cal Poly Pomona Rodeo Club is a student-run organization 
dedicated to the perpetuation of the rodeo sport. The club sponsors many activities throughout 
the year, including high school and intercollegiate rodeos. Club members have the opportunity to 
participate in a wide variety of rodeo events and benefit from the experience and expertise of 
professional instructors.   

          The Rodeo Club works hard to prepare for this event, Oakleaf says. Although not 
everyone competes, all of the members do their part to support the rodeo and help out where they 
can.

                Special Thursday Arabian Horse Shows at Cal Poly Pomona 
                                       Target Local Youngsters 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Cal Poly Pomonas renowned W.K. Kellogg Arabian Horse Center 
will host two special shows on Thursdays, April 10 and May 1. Though the shows are timed 
ideally for youngsters on field trips and groups, anyone can attend. Reservations are required. 
              The hour-long shows begin at 10:30 a.m. each day and cost $1 for children and adults. 
Local schools are encouraged to attend.  
              The horse show spotlights the versatility, beauty and intelligence of the Arabian breed. 
The horse show is the universitys oldest tradition. It was started in 1926 by cereal magnate 
W.K. Kellogg, whose 813-acre ranch would later make up a large portion of the Cal Poly 
Pomona campus.  

        The Arabian Horse Center will also host the remainder of this seasons Sunday shows at 
2 p.m. on April 6 and May 4. Sunday shows are free for children under five, $2 for seniors and 
children and $3 for adults.

            Grant to Help Improve the Transfer of Supply-Chain Coursework  
                        from Community College to Cal Poly Pomona 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Community college students who want to study supply chain 
management at Cal Poly Pomona will have an easier time finishing their coursework thanks to a 
$60,800 grant from the California Transportation and Logistics Institute (CALTI).  

        The 1-year grant has been awarded to the Technology and Operations Management 
(TOM) department in the universitys College of Business Administration (CBA). Funds will go 
to enhance collaboration between the university and Rio Hondo, Riverside, Mt. San Antonio, 
East Los Angeles and Chaffey community colleges.  

        Currently, some TOM-related courses are not transferable into the California State 
University system, including Cal Poly Pomona. The grant will help change that, said Dr. Hassan 
Halati who will oversee the grant.  

        The purpose is to expose students to this growing area and make it easier for them to 
complete their studies, Halati said.  

        The grant will cover areas of study that include logistics, transportation management and 
quality management. In the Spring quarter, TOM and CBA will open a state-of-the-art lab that 
will expose students to new and emerging technologies in supply chain management.  

        Beneficiaries of this grant extend beyond participating colleges and students. As more 
goods and products are made abroad, there is a strong need for professionals that are skilled in 
overseeing operations in this high-tech environment. By 2030, 350,000 more jobs will be needed 
to maintain the flow of goods throughout Southern California, according to CALTI.

       Salaries in supply chain management are just as impressive as the job growth.  

       Professionals with up to five years of experience in supply chain management can earn an 
average of $65,389, according to a 2006 salary survey from the Institute for Supply 
Management. Last years TOM graduates who studied logistics and supply chain management 
work in entry-level positions that pay between $45,000 to $60,000, Halati said. Companies that 
recruited TOM student include Fluor, Smart & Final and Nestle.

                       Cyber Defense Competition at Cal Poly Pomona 
                         Spotlights Emerging Field of Cyber Security 
                      Los Angeles County DA Steve Cooley Provides Keynote 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  The demand has never been higher for trained experts who can 
protect our personal privacy, even the safety of our country, from criminals who lurk in 
cyberspace.  

        Cal Poly Pomonas Computer Information Systems department is once again leading the 
way in educating the next generation of cyber security experts. On March 28-30, the department 
will host the Western Regional Cyber Defense Competition at the universitys campus. Eight-
member student teams from Cal Poly Pomona, Cal State San Bernardino, Sacramento State and 
Mt. San Antonio College will vie for a spot in next months national competition at the 
University of Texas at San Antonio.  

         Our hosting of the first Western Regional CCDC emphasizes the Cal Poly Pomona 
learn by doing approach to education, and our strong partnerships with industry and 
government agencies in the important area of cyber security, said Dan Manson, professor of 
Computer Information Systems in the College of Business Administration.  

        During the three days of the competition, students will pretend to be network 
administrators for a fictional company. While students perform routine tasks such as establishing 
employee e-mail accounts, a group of industry experts will attempt to threaten the computer 
infrastructure of each team. Opposing sides will engage a war games scenario of attack and 
protect. The team that was able to provide the most security to their network will win the 
competition.

       During break from competition, students will get to meet with industry experts in cyber 
security. Also, Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley will make the opening 
keynote address at 12 p.m. on Friday, March 28. Assistant U.S. Attorney Mitch Dembin will 
deliver closing remarks at 9 a.m. on Sunday March 30.  

       Since 2004, the National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition has been giving students 
a glimpse of the pressures and demands of securing a network in the real world. This year, there 
are six regional competitions and nearly 100 schools throughout the country are expected to 
compete. This is the first year that the competition has offered a regional qualifying event in the 
Western United States.  

       Cal Poly Pomona is the only university in Southern California that has been designated 
an Academic Center of Excellence in Information Assurance Education by the U.S. Department 
of Homeland Security. Late last year, the university was a co-recipient of a $600,000 grant from 
the National Science Foundation to enhance its cyber security curriculum.   

       The Western Regional Cyber Defense Competition is sponsored by McAfee with 
additional support from International High Technology Crime Investigation Association, 
Information Systems Audit and Control Association, Microsoft, The Aerospace Corporation, 
Ernst & Young, Information Systems Security Association, Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
Engineers, Regional Information Systems Security Center, and the Center for Information 
Assurance.

                  CAL POLY POMONAS STATE OF THE ART GREENHOUSES  
                      PRODUCE HYDROPONIC LETTUCE FOR COMMUNITY                      
                                                     
        POMONA, Calif.  As cities and populations continue to grow pushing farms farther 
away from urban areas, it can be difficult to find hearty locally grown produce. But that's not the 
case at the Cal Poly Pomona Farm Store where one can now buy hydroponically grown lettuce 
for a scant $1 a head.  

         In one of eight new state-of-the-art greenhouses at the university, the College of 
Agriculture is cultivating hydroponic lettuce year-round and selling it a mere hundred yards 
away at the Farm Store at Kellogg Ranch. You don't get more locally grown than that. 

         Usually by the time you buy lettuce in a grocery store it was harvested six or seven days 
earlier, says Dan Hostetler, chair of the plant & soil science department. Our lettuce at the 
Farm Store will be sold within two days of being cut. All you have to do is taste it to tell the 
difference. 

         Delicious lettuce isn't the only benefit from this new venture. Continual planting of the 
leafy crop provides a real-world setting to teach agriculture students about hydroponics: the 
science of growing plants without soil. The method conserves water by cycling nutrient-rich 
water over the plants roots. In a region as arid as Southern California, water conservation is a 
vital key to sustainable farming, says Professor Terrance Fujimoto, who teaches hydroponics. 

         In North America, the hydroponic greenhouse farming industry is valued at more than 
$2.4 billion and is growing at a rate of 10 percent per year, according to the Progressive 
Gardening Trade Association, which promotes earth-friendly, organic and water-wise gardening. 
In California, greenhouse/nursery products are the second leading agricultural commodities

        It's important for us to stay on top of industry trends, so we can prepare our students to 
pursue careers in that industry if they choose, Fujimoto says. 

        Fujimoto first taught hydroponics several years ago in the Horticulture Unit greenhouses 
that will soon be demolished to make way for a $41 million College of Business Administration 
building. In the past year, eight new greenhouses totaling about 35,000 square feet have been 
built at AGRIscapes, a 40-acre complex on campus that showcases sustainable farming and 
urban landscaping practices that are environmentally beneficial, economically viable and 
technologically sound. 

        This past fall quarter, Fujimotos taught a class on hydroponics and students improved 
their crop production thanks to the advanced design of the new facility. The new greenhouses 
feature automated shade systems, insect screening, heating units and automatically controlled 
ventilation. 

        It's amazing coming here from the old greenhouses. We managed to get two crops in 
one quarter using the new greenhouses, as opposed to one crop in the old building, Fujimoto 
says. We were really able to speed up production because we can monitor the environment so 
closely.

             BOEING BRINGS THE SPACE EXPERIENCE TO CAL POLY POMONA                          
                                                     
        POMONA, Calif.  Students will enjoy an up-close look at spacecraft design at Cal Poly 
Pomonas new Orbital Space Plane Crew Capsule Mockup (OSPCCM), generously donated by 
the Boeing Co. to the College of Engineering.  

        The capsule mockup was originally built for a 2004 joint Boeing/Northrop Grumman 
space project. The capsule is designed to accommodate, safely protect and sustain four astronauts 
during space launch and recovery operations.  

        Mockup models such as the OSPCCM are generally out of reach for publicly-funded 
universities. However, Boeing engineer and designer Xavier Simon recommended the mockup 
be donated as a human simulation or demonstration tool.  

        The mockup will be used as an educational tool in the universitys Human Factors

instrumentation, launch and recovery systems and spacecraft design. 

        Utilization of the capsule would significantly add learn-by-doing value to the Cal Poly 
Pomona methods of teaching, said Charles Varela, director of development for the College of 
Engineering. It will significantly broaden the traditional lab experience and promote multi-
discipline team involvement in many design-and-build projects.

          CAL POLY POMONA STUDENT WINS OUTSTANDING ATTORNEY AWARD  
                            AT NATIONAL MOCK TRIAL COMPETITION                
                                                     
        POMONA, Calif.  A member of the Cal Poly Pomona Mock Trial team brought home 
the highly coveted All National Outstanding Attorney Award at the American Mock Trial 
Association Desert Classic National Tournament in Tucson, Ariz., March 14-16.             

        Chino resident James Perrys performance as lead prosecuting attorney earned him one of 
only 11 awards for the 150 student-attorneys participating.  

        Other notable performances included a perfect score garnered by prosecuting attorney 
Chris Montoya of Diamond Bar.  Ella Tarnate of Cerritos and Sara Yohay of Claremont both 
received perfect scores for their portrayals of a crime victim and an expert trial witness, 
respectively. Yohay managed double-duty as both a witness and as a criminal defense attorney.   

         Members of the Cal Poly Pomona Mock Trial team are students selected by political 
science lecturer Raul C. Sabado.  Students must first enroll and complete PLS 308 in the fall 
quarter.  This political science course teaches students the law of evidence, trial advocacy and 
substantive law.  

         I teach the class like it is part of a law school curriculum, said Sabado. The 
department and I think its very important to give pre-law students a realistic opportunity to get a 
taste of the rigors of law school.  

         Though the program finds its home in the Political Science Department, the class is open 
to all majors and has no prerequisites. For more information, visit www.calpolymocktrial.com.

                Cal Poly Pomona Community Unites on April 8 
                                 to Protest State Budget Cuts 
 
        Pomona, Calif.  March 27, 2008  Cal Poly Pomona's Horse Show Team is riding its regional 
victories all the way to New York and Idaho to further its stance in the Intercollegiate Horse Show 
Association competitions. 

        The Hunt Seat riders will compete in the Zone 8 Championships at the College of Southern Idaho 
on April 12 , while the Western riders will head to the semifinals in Cazenovia, New York on March 30 .  

         "This is an amazing achievement for our team and school," says Jing Li, the team's historian. "I do 
not believe any other sports team on campus beat out schools like UCLA and USC." 

         Depending on how the team places in these events, chances are that it just might get to saddle up 
for the national competition in May. 

         "I think we have a pretty good chance at nationals," says Carolyn LaPrade, Hunt Seat captain. "Last 
year, Hunt Seat got second place at zones and we almost made it to nationals. This year's victories have 
been amazing so far. The team has grown significantly since I first started and we work very hard." 

         The Cal Poly Pomona Horse Show Team is a member of IHSA's Zone 8, Region 2, and rides out of 
the W. K. Kellogg Arabian Horse Center. 

         The team attracts students from a variety of disciplines and requires a year-round commitment to 
care for nearly 20 horses. Any student can join, and owning a horse or having experience is not required. 
The team is a club funded by ASI and fundraisers.  

         "Some schools will pay hundreds of dollars for lessons, trainers and other things for equestrian 
clubs," LaPrade says. "Our club is all self-taught and we do all of the work and horse care ourselves, which 
                                                    more 

not only lowers the costs and increases membership, but it also makes our accomplishments even more 
rewarding." 

         The team will participate with other Southern California schools in hosting, and hopefully 
competing in, the IHSA Nationals in May at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center in Burbank. 

         IHSA has more than 350 colleges and more than 7,500 riders, making it the world's largest 
intercollegiate equestrian organization. The Cal Poly Pomona team competes in shows throughout the 
region. Riders may choose to participate in Hunt Seat or Western equitation ranging from beginning 
walk/trot and walk/jog classes to open over fences and reining classes.

        Cal Poly Pomonas National Juried Exhibit Ink and Clay  
                Showcases Best of Printmaking and Ceramic Art 

                      Free Reception and Awards Ceremony Scheduled April 10

Poly Pomona is showcasing Ink and Clay 34 from March 25  May 3. The exhibit represents the best of 
printmaking and ceramic art from a national juried exhibition. 

         A free reception and awards ceremony will be held Thursday, April 10, 7-9 p.m.

                Cal Poly Pomona Community Unites on April 8 
                                 to Protest State Budget Cuts 
 
      WHAT:    Cal Poly Pomona President Michael Ortiz, CSU Trustee Lou Monville, faculty, staff, 
                students, union members and concerned members of the community will unite to lead a 
                budget forum to protest Governor Schwarzeneggers proposed budget cuts.  

      WHEN:  Tuesday, April 8 , noon to 1 p.m. 

     WHERE:  University Quad  
                (Cal Poly Pomona is located at 3801 W. Temple Ave. in Pomona) 

       WHY:  Affordable higher education and the preparation of the states workforce are at risk. 
                Governor Schwarzeneggers proposed budget slashes funding to the California State 
                University by a total of $386 million. This reduction includes a direct cut of $313 million 
                and fails to fund $73 million necessary to avoid raising student fees by 10 percent for 
                the 2008-09 academic year. Cal Poly Pomonas share of the cuts would be about 5 
                percentnearly $20 million. To put this in perspective, this cut would be greater than 
                the total budget of the College of Agriculture.  

                     The proposed funding cut comes only three years after the CSU budget was reduced 
                by more than $500 million during the 2002-03 and 2004-05 fiscal years. Those cuts led 
                to significantly reduced student access, as well as a dramatic increase in student fees. 

                     The budget forum will spotlight the fact the CSU is the Solution  to many of 
                Californias economic issues. Cal Poly Pomona and the CSU prepare the future 
                workforce in key areas such as science, technology, education, healthcare, agriculture 
                and more. Earlier research has found that the CSU returns $4.41 to the California 
                economy for every $1 invested.

              Cal Poly Pomona Landscape Architecture Students  

           Explore Ways to Improve Unsightly Beach-End Streets 

                  Student Work on Display at Downtown Laguna Beach Storefront 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  April 4, 2008  They may still be college students, but Cal Poly Pomona 
landscape architecture majors will have their handiwork on display in downtown Laguna Beach. The 
students spent winter quarter developing proposals to improve three beach-end streets (roads that dead-
end at the ocean) that were in dire need of attention. 

        A large vacant storefront at 225 Forest Ave. was recently donated to showcase the students 
diagrams and models, which are on display from April 3 until the space is leased.  

        The Laguna Beach Chamber of Commerces Beautification Council asked Cal Poly Pomona 
landscape architecture faculty members to assist in the project, which was led by assistant professor Andy 
Wilcox and adjunct faculty members Paul Norconk, Mark Holden, James Becerra and Sam Sabin.  

        Our students got a chance to apply what they have learned in class to a real-life situation, said 
Wilcox. We asked the students to look at the street ends from all aspects, open themselves up to the 
possibilities and provide something that is not only useful, but attractive, accessible and an appropriate fit 
for their community and environment. 

        Nearly 80 undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in Landscape Architecture 332: Landscape 
Construction and took on the project in small teams. Students spoke with residents, delved into each sites 
unique history and patterns of use before designing the beach-street ends.

        As a landscape architect most of what we build is public space, and the public has opinions about 
the space we all share, said graduate student Scott Goodman. It has been exciting to be at the heart of 
that dialog and to learn about the many roadblocks and limited avenues. This has taught me that landscape 
architects need not only to be great designers, but must also be relentless in their involvement with the 
community if they ever want to see their designs constructed.

                   State Assemblyman Ed Hernandez to Provide  
                           Budget Forum at Cal Poly Pomona 

                Student Organized Event Focuses on Educating, Empowering Public 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  April 7, 2008  Cal Poly Pomonas Associated Students Inc. have organized an 
educational budget forum featuring California State Assemblyman Dr. Ed Hernandez (D-West Covina) in the 
universitys Bronco Student Center, Ursa Major A.  

        Scheduled to speak on Friday, April 11 at noon, Hernandez will discuss the current budget deficit, 
the budget process, the allocation of funds, and how the proposed budget cuts affect everyone in the CSU 
system. A question and answer session will follow his presentation. 

        "We are facing a serious budget crisis, and we will need everyone working together to find a 
solution. But I do not believe we should be balancing the budget on the backs of our students," said Dr. 
Hernandez.  "It is critical that we all be well-informed during this budget process, and I thank the students 
at Cal Poly Pomona for creating the opportunity for this kind of discussion." 

        According to student organizers the purpose of this event is to educate, inform and empower 
everyone at Cal Poly Pomona and in the community. 

         We are so thankful Dr. Hernandez could provide this educational forum, said Gerald Angel, the 
student bodys secretary of external affairs. We are trying to make Californians aware that they should 
stand up and fight for their education. Fees have gone up dramatically since I began studying at Cal Poly 
and will only keep increasing unless we do something to change it. 

        Assemblyman Hernandez represents the 57th Assembly District, which includes the cities of Azusa, 
Baldwin Park, Covina, La Puente, West Covina, Irwindale, Industry, and other unincorporated areas of Los 
Angeles County.

                     Childish Things by Davis & Davis in Play  
                  at Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center Gallery 

           Free Artists Reception April 12 During Pomonas Second Saturday Art Walk 
 

        POMONA, Calif.  April 8, 2008  The colorful photographic exhibit 

Childish Things by Los Angeles-based art team Scott and Denise Davis is 
open through April 26  at the Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center.  

        The  husband and wife team has been gently skewering the 
presumptions and preoccupations of American society with their mixed-media 
installations and, especially, their set-up photographs for the past decade. In 
their exhibition and book, Childish Things, the Davises use found and 
discarded toys to stage startling psychological dramas. Through the clever use 
of color and selective focus, their photographs transform into potent dioramas 
of the former toy-owners bleary memories. 

        The free reception will be held on April 12 , from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. 
during the Pomona Arts Colony Second Saturday Art Walk, a monthly event 
where close to two dozen galleries and arts-based businesses offer exhibits, artists receptions, music and 
open houses for visitors strolling through the neighborhood. 

         The Cal Poly Pomona Downtown Center gallery is free and open to the public. It is located at 300 
W. Second St. in Pomonas Arts Colony. Gallery hours are noon to 8 p.m., Tuesday through Saturday. For 
more information, call (909) 469-0080.

                 Darden Restaurants Foundation Awards Grant  

to Cal Poly Pomona Collins School for Students Professional Travel 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  April 8, 2008  Cal Poly Pomona students from The Collins School of 
Hospitality Management will have more professional development opportunities than ever thanks to a new 

$50,000 grant from the Darden Restaurants Foundation. 

        The grant will be added to the Darden Experience the Industry Award endowment, which has 

provided students with financial assistance to attend industry conferences and trade shows since 2003.  

        "Few of our students can afford traveling to industry conferences on their own," said Andy 

Feinstein, dean of The Collins School. "Darden's ongoing support allows our students to compliment their 

education through enriching professional development outside the classroom." 

         This grant marks the second contribution to this endowment from Darden Restaurants, which owns 

several chains including Red Lobster and Olive Garden. In 2003, the foundation gave The Collins School 

$50,000, which was matched by Carol and Jim Collins and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation to create a 
$150,000 endowment for student scholarships.  

         Attending conferences and trade shows invoke Cal Poly Pomona's learn-by-doing philosophy 

because students are able to interact with and learn from professionals in the hospitality industry. This 

May, for example four Collins School students will each be given $300 to supplement their travel expenses 

to attend the National Restaurant Association's Restaurant, Hotel-Motel Show in Chicago. 

         Past scholarship recipients have also attended the International Hotel & Restaurant Show, the 

Western Foodservice Show and the Las Vegas International Restaurant Show.

                            Cal Poly Pomona Students Provide  
            Free Homework Assistance at Pomona Public Library 
                                Grand Opening Event Scheduled April 15 
                                                          
        POMONA, Calif.  April 11, 2008  Cal Poly Pomonas Center for Community Service-Learning 
will unveil a new homework assistance center dedicated to empowering local schoolchildren. The grand 
opening will be Tuesday, April 15 from 3  4 p.m. at the center, located in the Pomona Public Library, 625 S. 
Garey Ave. 

        The public is welcome to the free event, where they will be joined by prominent businesspeople 
and Cal Poly Pomonas first lady Betty Ortiz, who is also a member of the universitys advisory group 
Partners in Education (PIE).  

        Located in the Pomona Public Librarys story-telling area, the homework assistance center provides 
free services to local schoolchildren from third to sixth grade. Children are also supplied with activities and 
snacks.  

        Families interested in the free service are welcome to come in at any time during the centers 
hours. The center is open Tuesdays through Thursdays from 4  6 p.m.  

        Headed by Cal Poly Pomona student Charlene Wyatt, the homework center is staffed by a total of 
25 Cal Poly Pomona student volunteers who dedicate several hours each week at the center.  

        This is a chance for volunteers to work in their community, said Wyatt, a senior liberal studies 
student and AmeriCorps Promise Fellow. Those who come in to volunteer are future teachers and 
educators, so this gives them a lot of experience.

Cal Poly Pomona  Free Homework Assistance 
Page 2 of 2 

        The idea for a homework center began in December 2007 as a collaboration between the 
universitys Center for Community Service-Learning and PIE to motivate childrens interest in homework and 
learning. Additionally, the centers volunteers would serve as role models to the children, whom they 
mentor and encourage to succeed.  

        By March 4, the homework center opened and began accepting its first students.  

        For volunteer Ivan Garcia, a freshman Cal Poly Pomona construction engineering student, the most 
rewarding aspect of working at the homework center is knowing he made a difference in his tutees 
learning.  

        Seeing positive results on their tests puts a big smile on my face, said Garcia. Working at the 
center benefits me as well because it allows me to explore new ways of teaching. 

        The homework center works closely with liberal studies professor Dr. Christina Chavez and her 
service learning class in developing outreach presentations to elementary schools in the Pomona Unified 
School District. Additionally, Cal Poly Pomonas Center for Community Service-Learning is promoting the 
service through visits at the Downtown Centers Family Fun Days, and to Pomona recreational centers and 
churches.  

        The homework center is funded by AmeriCorps and the Center for Community Service-Learning. 
Most recently, Athens Trash Services donated two laptop computers and a printer. In addition, David 
Bogardus, head librarian for the Pomona Unified School District, donated textbooks.

             Cal Poly Pomona Students Guide Pomona Youths in  
                 Helping Local Businesses with Marketing Plans 

         Top Student Teams from The School of Arts and Enterprise Recognized April 18 
 

        POMONA, Calif.  April 16, 2008 More than 15 local businesses received much-needed 
assistance with marketing and publicity thanks to the work of Cal Poly Pomona and The School of Arts and 
Enterprise students.  

        Now its the students turn to get the spotlight at a recognition ceremony on April 18, from 10:30 
a.m. to noon at the American Museum of Ceramic Art, 340 S. Garey Ave. in Pomona. Students in the five 
top-performing teams will share $4,000 of scholarships in the form of savings bonds. 

        Since 2007, the university and the Pomona-based charter high school have worked with small 
business owners and managers in Pomona to enhance their marketing efforts. Students groups do 
everything from design fliers to advocate Web marketing.  

         Some of the businesses that participated this year include a Mexican restaurant that did not have 
anyone on staff to design fliers and a new hair salon that was looking for ways to introduce itself to the 
community. The dA Center for the Arts in Downtown Pomona plans to try some new promotional 
techniques. 

         "I think it's great that they helped out because we don't have much staff," said Tiffani McEwan, 
manager of the dA Center for the Arts, a nonprofit group that offers arts shows and promotes arts 
education. "I want to bring [the business students] down to a meeting and have them make a presentation 
to our board members."  

         The project is funded by a three-year, $200,000 grant from the Merrill Lynch Foundation to The

School of Arts and Enterprise. This year, 17 Cal Poly Pomona business majors acted as mentors to the high 
school students, guiding them through process of research and project management and helping them 
refine their public speaking skills.   

        This collaboration exemplifies Cal Poly Pomona's learn-by-doing approach to education, according 
to Cheryl Wyrick, chair of the Management and Human Resources (MHR) department.  

         "The program provides Cal Poly Pomona students a preview of real-life managementdetermining 
priorities, setting clear and achievable goals and monitoring progress," Wyrick said. "It allows our students 
the opportunity to convey what they've learned in their classes to local business owners and provide for 
them a different perspective on success strategies for their business." 

         MHR senior Claudia Gutierrez decided to get involved in the project because she wants to launch 
her own community-based non-profit for children and teens. She enjoys the business side of non-profit 
management but Gutierrez wanted to have the hands-on learning experience to make sure she was 
pursuing the right career.  

         "Working with the students was such a great experience," Gutierrez said. "I realized how much I 
have a passion working with youth."

                      Cal Poly Pomona Stages U.S. Premiere of  
                   Hard-hitting South African Play Full Circle  

                  Award-winning Drama Performed in Studio Theatre April 24-26 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  April 21, 2008  Cal Poly Pomonas Theatre Department will stage the U.S. 
premiere of the award-winning South African play Full Circle April 24-26 at 8 p.m. in the Studio Theatre. 

        The hard-hitting drama is written by acclaimed poet and playwright Kobus Moolman. It is directed 
by Christopher Hurst, a South African scholar teaching at Cal Poly Pomona through the prestigious Fulbright 
Scholar program. 

        Full Circle follows two girls, Meisie and Boetie, who lost their father during a hijacking. Meisie, 
who is blind, never forgot the voice that laughed as her father was shot. Seven years later, a police 
inspector arrives at the farm where she lives, and his voice is strangely familiar.  

        The play deals with bigotry, prejudice and religious fundamentalism, said Hurst. I think an 
American audience can find connections with these topics. 

        Full Circle has had successful runs in South Africa at the Market Theatre and the Grahamstown 
Festival, a well-known national South African theatre event where it premiered in 2005. It was awarded the 
Jury First Prize in the third PANSA Festival of Reading of New Writing.  

        This play is recommended for mature audiences only. Tickets are $10 for general admission and $5 
for students. Cal Poly Pomona is located at 3801 W. Temple Ave. in Pomona. Parking permits can be 
obtained for $5 at the Visitor Information Booth along Kellogg Drive. For more information, please call the 
Theatre Box Office at (909) 869-3800.

          Cal Poly Pomona Information Technology Competition 
 

        POMONA, Calif.  April 23, 2008 Some of the most talented students in Southern California

will compete for $1,000 prizes in the 12  Annual Information Technology Competition May 3 at Cal Poly 
Pomona.  

        The event is a challenging test of students skills. While they must have the technical knowledge 
to solve an IT problem, they must also possess the business savvy to determine how technology affects a 
companys bottom line and the communication skills to present the problem in a clear and concise manner.  

                                                                th
         This student-organized competition, which is in its 12  year, is a true testament to the learn-by-
doing approach to education, Dan Manson, professor of Computer Information Systems said. Student 
teams present solutions to business problems that are created and judged by top industry participants. 

        This years teams will compete in one of four IT specialties: computer forensics, Web application 
development, telecommunications, and business systems analysis. Experts, including those who work for 
Guidance Software, DreamBox Creations and Hitachi Consulting, will present an IT problem. Students then 
work in groups to solve the problem and present it to the industry professionals.   

        Students and faculty members from the Computer Information Systems (CIS) department are well-
suited to host this event. Cal Poly Pomona is the only institution in Southern California to be named a 
National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education by the U.S. Department of 
Homeland Security. Also, companies such as KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers heavily recruit CIS

                        Cal Poly Pomona Stages Tragi-Comedy

18 in the University Theatre.

Springs Awakening follows a dozen young people and their 

journey through the thrilling, complicated, confusing and mysterious time of their sexual awakening.

professor in the theatre department.  

        Springs Awakening is recommended for mature audiences only.

                       Cal Poly Pomonas Historic Rose Garden 
                                          Newly Renovated  
 
        POMONA, Calif. -  April 29, 2008 - Cal Poly Pomonas W.K. Kellogg Commemorative Rose Garden is 
budding with new life thanks to a complete renovation with top varieties donated by Weeks Roses.  

         Contrary to popular belief the roses in the garden did not stem from Kellogg's original garden. The 

footprint of the circular garden designed in 1926 by Charles Adams of Hearst Castle notoriety, remains 

intact. However, the roses have been replaced a handful of times in the past 80 years. 

         During the renovation this past winter, all of the viable rose bushes were replanted at other 

locations on campus. 

         "This garden is going to be beautiful," says Richard Farmer, manager of Cal Poly Pomona's 

Landscape Services. "Weeks Roses produces top-notch flowers, and we have all their prize-winning flowers 

in this garden." 

         In 2006, Weeks Roses moved its research operations to Cal Poly Pomona, where eight new state-
of-the-art green houses have been constructed. Since moving to campus, Tom Carruth, head of Weeks' 

research department, has looked for additional ways to partner with the university. 

         This past winter, about 650 bushes and 50 trees of top-producing varieties by Weeks Roses 

replaced the aging garden of about 400 plants. Next winter another 200 to 300 roses will be planted to fill 

in the rest of the garden, Farmer says. 

         "You could see that the plants were old and pretty tired and everything needed a punch up," says 

Carruth, who has produced 10 All-American Rose Selection winners. "This garden will have a lot of color 

and fragrance. It'll look great."

        POMONA, Calif.  May 8, 2008  Building robots for competition isnt just for college students. 
For the past four months, Cal Poly Pomona faculty and students have helped fourth and fifth grade students 
build sumo robots. The hands-on project will culminate with a Robotics Competition, on Tuesday, May 13 
from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. in the Cal Poly Pomona Engineering Atrium (Building 17). 

        During the competition, the childrens robots compete in bouts and are gradually eliminated until 
there is a winner. While there is only one robotic winner, all the youths come out on top with expanded 
knowledge of robotics and technology. 

        Since January, the 66 children from Kingsley Elementary in Pomona and Collegewood Elementary 
in Walnut have been building and programming LEGO Mindstorm robots with the help of the Cal Poly 
Pomona School Robotics Initiative. The School Robotics Initiative is a team of Cal Poly Pomona professors 
and students who work with the elementary school groups to enhance their education of robotics. Team 
members include Cesar Larriva, associate professor of education; Jill Nemiro, associate professor of 
Psychology & Sociology; and Mariappan "Jawa" Jawaharlal, associate professor of Mechanical 
Engineering. 

        This outreach is intended to inspire young minds so they are excited about science and technology. 
Initiative members hope that interesting these youths early will better prepare them to someday enter the 
science and technology disciplines. In addition, it allows university faculty to study how children take to 
learning about robotics.

         We hope our program will capture these students imagination early in their schooling, and that it 
will promote their interest in pursuing further study in the areas of science, technology, engineering and 
technology, said Larriva, head of the initiative. By engaging students in the kinds of problem-solving tasks 
that professionals tackle everyday in the field, our program provides students an authentic view of how 
these disciplines are interrelated and important. 

        The Cal Poly Pomona School Robotics Initiative plans to someday develop a network of schools in 
surrounding communities. This network will give interested students the option to participate in robotics 
from elementary through high school. Participating students will emerge with hands-on experience and 
technical skills, and be better prepared to succeed in college. 

        The robotics equipment is provided for the children, who generally wouldnt have access to such 
technology at home. This years program is sponsored by a private foundation.

        POMONA, Calif. May 14, 2008 Qualified Cal Poly Pomona transfer students will greatly 
benefit from a generous donation from the Bernard Osher Foundation.  

        The Foundation has committed to donate $16 million to support endowed scholarships for 
California Community College students transferring to designated California State University campuses, 
including Cal Poly Pomona. This gift is part of the foundations overall $70 million private donation to the 
states community college system. 

        Cal Poly Pomona will share a total of $1 million each year that will go to 11 CSU campuses 
including Bakersfield, California Maritime Academy, Channel Islands, Dominguez Hills, Fresno, Humboldt, 
Los Angeles, Monterey Bay, Pomona, San Marcos and Stanislaus. Four campuses including Fullerton, 
Northridge, San Diego and San José will receive $1.25 million due to the large number of community 
college transfer students enrolled at these campuses.  

        Approximately 60 percent of California State University students transfer from a state community

                                    Cal Poly Pomona to Stage  
                                 Active Shooter Drill May 23 

                                                           
         POMONA, Calif.  May 16, 2008  The campus shooting will be staged, but the lessons will be 

very real when Cal Poly Pomona conducts an active shooter drill on Friday, May 23. This is part of an 

ongoing effort by the university for emergency preparedness.  

         The active shooter drill will be held at an undisclosed time and location. A number of groups will 

take part in the exercise, including university students and staff, University Police Department, Pomona 

Police Department, Los Angeles County Fire Station No. 187 and Los Angeles County Sheriffs Departments 

Walnut/Diamond Bar Station.  

         Drills are meant to help the university improve emergency response procedures and response times 

in a real emergency situation. The university conducts emergency exercises year round with varying 

scenarios.  Last June, the University Police and Pomona Police Department jointly participated in an active 

shooter training scenario.  

         Cal Poly Pomona is among 23 CSU campuses holding active shooter drills this spring.

                  Cal Poly Pomona Named a National Center of  
                        Academic Excellence in Cyber Security 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  May 30, 2008  Cal Poly Pomona once again has cemented its role as a 
national leader in cyber security education thanks to some recognition from the National Security Agency 
and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  

        The federal agencies recently announced that Cal Poly Pomonas designation as a Center of 
Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education has been renewed until 2013. The designation in 
information assurance, also known as cyber security, is based on the curriculum and faculty research in the 
Computer Information Systems (CIS) department in the College of Business Administration (CBA).  

        This year, Cal Poly Pomona was one of only six institutions in the state -- and one of 93 institutions 
throughout the country -- to receive a designation as a Center of Academic Excellence.  

        This university-level designation reflects the bottom-up commitment of CIS faculty, CBA 
administrators and campus security professionals to the importance of information assurance, said CIS 
Professor Dan Manson.  

        The federal government began designating Centers of Academic Excellence out of the need to have 
trained professionals who can make the Internet and computer networks safe and, as a result, help stabilize 
our economy and bolster our national security. Many CIS graduates have gone on to work for law 
enforcement agencies helping to prevent identity theft and other cyber crimes. Many more work for private 
companies, protecting computer networks from thieves trying to steal information.

        Cal Poly Pomona first received the designation in 2005 and has quickly become a recognized leader 
in information assurance. CIS faculty members are sought after by law enforcement agencies and network 
professional throughout the world to talk about the importance of cyber security. They also consult other 
institutions in the CSU system on how to become a Center of Academic Excellence.  

        The renewed designation will give the CBA an opportunity to continue providing a knowledgeable 
workforce in a growing business field.  According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, five of the 20 
fastest growing jobs between 2004 and 2014 will be in computing disciplines, including information 
assurance. Also, being a Center of Academic Excellence will make students and the university eligible to 
apply for scholarships and grants from federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of Defense.  

        Cal Poly Pomona will formally be recognized for its re-designation at an awards ceremony on June 
4 at the University of Texas at Dallas.

                     Pomona Health Career Ladder Helps  
                        Local Youths Attain Career Goals 
                  Pomona Unified, Cal Poly Pomona and Western University  
                                Collaborate to Step Up Choices   
 
POMONA, Calif.  Pomona Unified School District, California State Polytechnic University, 
Pomona, and Western University of Health Sciences are partnering to guide Pomona students 
through their education and into careers as health care professionals. 
 
Dr. Thelma Meléndez de Santa Ana, superintendent of Pomona Unified School District, Dr. J. 
Michael Ortiz, president of Cal Poly Pomona, and Dr. Philip Pumerantz, president of Western 
University of Health Sciences, signed a memorandum of understanding to develop the Pomona 
Health Career Ladder. 
 
The three leaders will introduce the Career Ladder program to the community at a signing 
ceremony on Wednesday, June 11, 2008 at 9 a.m. at Cortez Mathematics and Science Magnet 
School, 1300 N. Dudley St., Pomona. (Thomas Bros. Map page 600, F-7) 
 
The Career Ladder will identify math and science scholars in Pomona schools, guide them 
through an undergraduate health/science degree at Cal Poly Pomona and into health professions 
programs at WesternU through a program-based network of outreach, guidance, mentoring and 
financial assistance. In addition, the parties hope to generate support groups to provide private 
sources of financial aid for these scholars. The ultimate goal is to produce health care 
professionals who will serve the Pomona community. 
 
The three organizations are all involved in the Pomona Youth and Family Master Plan, which 
addresses problems such as gang violence and poor academic achievement by fostering a caring 
community that promotes positive youth development through collaboration. The Career Ladder 
will be one of their major contributions to this effort.

This gives children a chance to become successful and to make a contribution to society, 
Pumerantz said. Its to give children in the school system a view of what their future could be. 
 
One of the programs distinctions is its focus on local youths. 
 
There are great minds in Pomona, and the Career Ladder is designed to encourage their 
success, Ortiz said. We know that a strong demand exists for science and health professionals 
in all of California. It seems natural that Pomona Unified, Cal Poly Pomona and Western 
University work together so young people interested in these fields can advance. 
 
Dr. Meléndez said the Pomona Health Career Ladder fits perfectly with the PUSD School 
Boards desire to create new and better options for students.  
 
Parents have told us that they want more options for their children, she said.  Cortez 
Mathematics and Science Magnet School is a direct result of those conversations.  Theyve also 
told us that they want their children to have more options after graduation, and the Career Ladder 
is a wonderful option that can help students begin while theyre still with us. 
 
An advisory committee composed of representatives of all three institutions is being formed to 
create the details of the program, establish selection criteria, and develop the processes of 
mentoring and supporting students throughout their time in the program.

           University President Michael Ortiz to sign formalizing documents on June 13 
 

        POMONA, Calif.  June 6, 2008  The Collins School of Hospitality Management at Cal Poly 
Pomona will officially be renamed The Collins College of Hospitality Management. The new status 
positions The Collins College of Hospitality Management to be the first hospitality management college in 
the California State University system and among about six nationwide. 

        Cal Poly Pomona President Michael Ortiz will sign the formal documents authorizing the name 
change on Friday, June 13, at 2 p.m. prior to The Collins Schools commencement ceremony.  Carol and Jim 
Collins, the namesakes and primary benefactors of the college, Dean Andy Feinstein, interim Provost 
Herman Lujan and Associate Dean Joseph Casey will be present for the signing. The signing will take place 
at the Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch. 

        Cal Poly Pomonas hospitality program is one of the best in the country. It is fitting that it receives 
the proper designation, President Michael Ortiz said.  This is more than just changing a name. It sends a 
message that Cal Poly Pomona is a leader in hospitality management education. 

        The Collins School has played a major role in the maturation of hospitality management education 
in California. Founded in 1973, the program is the first and largest four-year hospitality Bachelor of Science 
degree program in the state and is consistently ranked among the nations premier hospitality management 
programs.  

        This is a significant milestone for us, Dean Andy Feinstein said. I see tremendous symbolism in

having the signing take place before commencement because The Collins School is in essence graduating 
into a college. 

        The process to become a college requires a vote by the Academic Senate, which is the governing 
body for the Cal Poly Pomona faculty. The senate passed the recommendation unanimously on May 14 
following a formal review process.  The measure is also supported by the Cal Poly Pomona Deans Council 
and Interim Provost Herman Lujan. 

        The official name change will go into effect on July 1, 2008. 

        Brief History:  

        The Collins School is ideally located in one of the largest hospitality markets in the world. It began 
as a department in the College of Business Administration in 1973 in response to the demand for qualified 
management due to the hospitality industrys explosive growth. At the time it was the first four-year 
hospitality degree offered on the West Coast. Continued growth led to the creation of the Center for 
Hospitality Management in 1986. In 1991, it became the School of Hotel and Restaurant Management. In 
1999, the program evolved into The Collins School of Hospitality Management when it became the first 
privately funded academic facility on a state university campus. The buildings were made possible by $11 
million of contributions which were funded entirely from the hospitality industry.  

        Serving nearly 850 ethnically diverse students, The Collins School offers a rigorous education firmly 
rooted in hospitality management theories and real-world applications. A customized curriculum prepares 
students for careers in hotel resort management, restaurant management, club management, culinary 
product development, tourism management and special events/meeting planning.

                           Cal Poly Pomonas Baja SAE Team  
                      Places First in International Competition 

                         Off-Road Vehicle Outperforms More than 100 Others 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  June 9, 2008  Despite brutally challenging courses and a sheared drive 
shaft, Cal Poly Pomonas Baja SAE Team raced to a first place finish at the 2008 Baja SAE competition in 
Edwards, Illinois. About 115 teams from around the world built off-road vehicles for the competition, held 
May 29-June 1 at Caterpillars Edwards Demonstration Center. 

        Formerly called the Mini-Baja, the Baja SAE challenges teams to design and build an off-road 
vehicle that must survive the severe punishment of rough terrain and sometimes even water.  

         There were fallen trees, stumps, huge gullies and ruts, and lots of mud. This was the most 
challenging course I can remember in my 14 years as SAE faculty advisor, and the toll on the vehicles was 
brutal, said mechanical engineering professor Clifford Stover.  

        The Cal Poly Pomona team took the overall win thanks to consistently strong performances 
throughout the 3-day competition. They earned a second place finish in the all-day endurance race and 
second place in all combined dynamic events, which includes the Hill Climb, Rock Crawl, Maneuverability 
and Acceleration. Students were also judged on static events such as engineering design judging, 
marketing and sales presentation.  

        On the last day of competition, the Baja SAE team faced a major hurdle during the all-day 
endurance race. The team was leading the field when a mistake in a rocky section sheared the vehicles left 
drive shaft at the weld, and was forced to be towed into the pits. Thanks to a tig welder from LeTourneau

University in Texas, the Cal Poly Pomona team was back in the race in 15 minutes. By the races end, Cal 
Poly Pomona was only 5 seconds from the first place endurance race vehicle. 

        We are ecstatic with our performance, said Stover. Our students' performance and 
professionalism is being commended not only SAE International, but all the corporate sponsors and 
competing universities alike. We are proud to be a top notch engineering school with exceptional students 
with excellent team skills. 

        The Baja SAE is one of the most exciting and popular events of the SAE Collegiate Design Series. It 
consists of three regional competitions that simulate real-world engineering design projects and related 
challenges.  

        In the coming weeks, the Formula SAE Racing Team will head off to compete in the SAE Formula

 Cal Poly Pomona Students Overcome Obstacles to Achieve Degrees  

                          University Shares Two Stories of Personal Triumph 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  June 10, 2008   Among the 3,700 students expected at Cal Poly Pomonas 
commencement exercises are those with inspiring stories of emotional, mental and physical perseverance 
to earn a college degree.  
        A Newport Beach resident was two quarters from a degree when a car accident put her in a coma, 
and her academic ambitions were put aside as she relearned how to walk and talk. Then theres a mother 
of two from Placentia who decided to return to school to achieve her dream of becoming a dietician and the 
first person in her family to earn a college degree.  
        Pamela Riungu, 28, of Corona del Mar/Newport Beach            
         It took 10 years, more than a dozen surgeries and relearning how to walk and talk so business 
administration student Pamela Riungu could attend her graduation.  
         In late 2002, the Kenya-born marketing student was preparing for her final two quarters at Cal Poly 
Pomona when she flew to New Jersey to visit her cousin. Riungu, her cousin and a friend had left a New 
Years Eve party at the same time a drunken driver was on the road. The drunken driver swerved out of his 
lane and crashed head-on into Riungus vehicle, causing his death and injuring Riungu, her cousin and friend.  
        Riungu suffered the most critical injuries with a coma, a broken back and severe internal injuries. 
When she awoke from her coma two-and-a-half months later, she was relieved to learn that her friends had 
survived the crash but she wasnt prepared for what the doctors told her. They said Riungu would never 
walk or talk again.  
         Riungu had to drop out of school to receive intensive physical, occupation and speech therapy. 
Where she once spent her days studying product analysis, she instead had to focus on holding a pen and

writing a word, both of which she had done effortlessly before. She also had to use all her mental and 
physical strength to stand for 40 seconds at a time.  
        You want to walk but your body doesnt want to move, Riungu said. Its a very painful and 
humbling experience.  
         Still, she never forgot about Cal Poly Pomona and her goal of earning a bachelors degree.  After 
years of treatment, Riungu was able to walk and talk again. By the summer of 2007, Riungu was back at Cal 
Poly Pomona to finish her degree.  
         It has always been a priority for me to finish my education, Riungu said. I am so blessed to have 
finished my classes and be able to walk in my graduation.  
        Cindy R. Allison, 46, of Placentia   
        College students arent always wide-eyed youths. Cindy Allison will be 46 years old when she 
becomes the first person in her family to earn a college degree. Ten years ago, the mother of two decided 
to return to school to become a registered dietician. She started at Fullerton College and transferred to Cal 
Poly Pomona five years ago.  
        Getting her diploma required a balancing act. Aside from rigorous coursework, Allison took pains to 
stay involved with her children, who were only 2 and 6 when she returned to school. In addition, she 
worked part time as a Weight Watchers leader.  
         When I took my first of three chemistry classes I really began to understand how hard this journey 
would be, she said. It brings tears to my eyes to know that I have finally made it. I am accomplishing 
something so important for myself and serving as a role model for my children. This is worth every exam, 
every paper, every minute spent studying. 
         
                             nd
        Cal Poly Pomonas 52  annual commencement ceremonies will be June 13-15 in the University

       Businessman Andrew J.C. Cherng to be Awarded Honorary 
 Doctorate at Cal Poly Pomona College of Business Commencement 
                                                        
        POMONA, Calif.  June 13, 2008  Cal Poly Pomona and The California State University will 
present an honorary doctorate to Andrew J.C. Cherng, founder and chairman of Panda Restaurant Group, 
Inc., (PRG), the parent company of Panda Inn, Panda Express and Hibachi-San. 
        The formal conferral will take place at 9 a.m. on Saturday, June 14, during the 2008 
commencement exercises for Cal Poly Pomona's College of Business Administration. 
        Cal Poly College of Business and Panda Restaurant Group share similar values in teaching and 
community involvement. I am humbled to receive this honorary doctorate from such a distinguished learning 
institution for which I have so much respect, said Cherng. 
        With a focus on developing relationships with his consumers, staff and community, Cherng and his 
family turned one storefront into the nationwide leader in Asian foodservice. 
        We are so pleased to honor Andrew Cherng for his accomplishments, said university President 
Michael Ortiz. He is truly an inspiration for our students. He developed his family business into an industry 
model, and all the while, he has maintained a commitment to bettering the lives of those in Panda 
Restaurant Group and the entire community. 
        PRG began in 1973 when Andrew and his father Master Chef Ming Tsai Cherng combined their 
talents to open Panda Inn, one of the first Chinese restaurants in Pasadena, Calif.  The menu is a cutting 
edge blend of styles from both Mandarin and Szechwan traditions that has introduced an array of new 
flavors to Southern California cuisine.   
        Cherng broke new ground in the restaurant industry by providing gourmet recipes in a quick service 
environment with the launch of Panda Express in 1983. Panda Express restaurants now include over 1,000 
locations throughout 36 states including Puerto Rico.

        Cherng believes that each new restaurant opening is another opportunity to impact the lives of 
both the associates and the community they serve. PRG currently employs over 18,000 associates and 
exceeded $1 billion in sales in 2007.  
        Never taking success for granted, Cherngs inside-out approach started before PRG gained its 
prominence as the worlds leader in Asian quick-service.  Not knowing whether the company he started 
would be as successful as it is today, Cherng applied his philosophy at every level of the company from the 
onset.  He encouraged people to challenge their way of thinking.  Whether it is improving the front-of-store 
experience or creating career paths for his associates, Cherng is challenged by how to encourage and 
inspire people to learn and better themselves, personally and professionally. What started as a passion for 
food has evolved into a passion for life, learning and people.  
        Cherngs commitment to the betterment of his associates extends to the community they serve.  
With his wife, Peggy, Andrew established Panda Cares and the Panda Charitable Foundation, which 
provides support to childrens organizations with monetary and food donations as well as volunteer support.  
Andrew and Peggy Cherng represent PRG on the board of directors at Methodist Hospital of Southern 
California, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles and are proud partners with the Childrens Miracle Network.   
        For his achievements, Andrew Cherng has been recognized with numerous awards including 
Entrepreneur of the Year by the Asia Society of Southern California in 2007.  In 2008, the Los Angeles 
Business Journal named the Cherngs Business Persons of the year and inducted them into its Business Hall 
of Fame.    
        Under Andrew Cherngs leadership, PRG was ranked No. 1 by QSR Magazine in the Asian quick-
service category for seven consecutive years.  In 2004, Panda Restaurant Group was named among the top 
five minority-owned businesses in Los Angeles by the Los Angeles Business Journal and was also 
recognized by the publication as one of the Best Places to Work in Los Angeles in 2007.  Moreover, in 2005, 
the Cherngs were inducted into the California Restaurant Associations Hall of Fame.  
        Andrew Cherng becomes the 14th person to be honored with an honorary doctorate at Cal Poly 
Pomona, joining Stuart Sperber (2007), Jack Dangermond (2005), Julia Child (2000), W.K. Kellogg (1998), 
Charles Oliver (1996), Charles Voorhis (1995), Norman Williamson (1995), W. Keith Kellogg (1994), Michi 
Nishiura Weglyn (1993), James Collins (1992), Bill Cosby (1992), Russell Mawby (1989) and Emory Morris

                Cal Poly Pomona Professor Receives Fulbright to  
            Help Center for Research in HIV/AIDS in Botswana 

              San Dimas Resident to Live and Work in African Country for Six Months 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  June 23, 2008  Some people go to the beach when they need a change of 
pace. Cal Poly Pomona professor Charles Gossett is going to Botswana. 

        The San Dimas resident has received a Fulbright Fellowship and will spend the next six months 
helping the University of Botswana develop its new Center for Research in HIV and AIDS. Gossett will leave 
for Botswana June 30.  

        Im looking forward to the opportunity to live and work in a different culture. The purpose of a 
sabbatical is to have a dramatic change of pace, and this will certainly offer an opportunity for that, said 
Gossett, who is also chair of the Political Science department.  

        The Fulbright Program is the U.S. government's flagship program in international educational 
exchange. Gossett will serve as a consultant to the research center. He anticipates that much of his work 
will be focused on developing a clear mission statement, establishing liaisons with other organizations and 
organizing academic programs and conferences.  

        The biggest challenge is going to be helping them figure out what role they want to play in the 
overall national fight against HIV and AIDS, and how theyre going to fit in with all the other actors who are 
working on that issue, he said. They also need to determine how the center fits in the university as a 
university entity. 

        It wont take long for Gossett to acclimate to the Fulbright post. In 1976, he did his dissertation 
work in Botswana as he worked toward a degree in African politics. Since then he has continued to follow 
the countrys developments and teaches about the country in his African politics class.

                       Cal Poly Pomona Hosts 2-Day Institute  
   Aimed for School Administrators to Raise Student Achievement 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  June 24, 2008  Giving school administrators the skills they need to support 
teachers and raise student achievement is the goal of a two-day institute at Cal Poly Pomona sponsored by 
the Teacher Quality Enhancement (TQE)/Teacher PREP grant. 

         Approximately 180 administrators from five area school districts will attend the first-ever Great 
Leaders for Great Schools Summer Institute on June 30 and July 1 to learn how they can improve school 
culture, increase meaningful collaboration among faculty and strengthen the alignment of processes, 
programs and resources to be coherent in schools. 

         "The Institute is a starting place for administrators to work on building the environment needed to 
support teachers in working with a diverse student population," said Christina Dehler, project director for 
the TQE/Teacher PREP grant. "School districts recognize that the Institute is very important to them and 
important to their strategic plans to move forward." 

         Participants include principals, assistant principals, superintendents and other district 
administrators from Baldwin Park Unified, Hacienda La Puente Unified, Pomona Unified, Rowland Unified 
and Valle Lindo School District. Cal Poly Pomona faculty and educational consultants from Springboard 
Schools will also attend the institute, which will be held at Kellogg West Conference Center. 

         Institute organizers hope to create a professional learning community during the two days by 
encouraging discussions among administrators within their school district and with their peers in other 
districts. Instead of lecture-style workshops, a lot of time will be spent on reflection and break-out sessions 
to share best practices and discuss what strategies might work at their respective schools.

         "We want administrators to feel they have a chance to express ideas, concerns and identify what 
they can do in their districts to enhance the creation of collaborative cultures and to make adjustments to 
promote learning," Dehler said. 

         Added Education Department associate professor Ron Leon: "We hope the districts will use the 
institute as a foundation or catalyst for their own training throughout the school year."  

         During the institute, speakers from six "turnaround" schools will present case studies and 
strategies that were successful at their schools. The speakers are: Cindy Paik, California Elementary in 
Orange; Damen Lopez, Los Penasquitos Elementary in San Diego; Janice Hanada, Cerritos Elementary in 
Glendale; Virginia Trapani, Yorba Linda Middle; Joe Medina, Torch Middle in Industry; and Loring Davies, 
Whittier High School.  

        Keynote speaker Dr. Anthony Muhammad, an expert on urban education, will share how 
professional learning communities can empower educators and improve schools.  

        Organizers hope the two-day session will be the start of an on-going leadership institute for 
educators in Southern California. They're already planning to host follow-up sessions during the school year 
to discuss new topics or tackle an issue in greater depth.  

        "Cal Poly Pomona can be a hub for the school districts in the area," Leon said. "We'd like to 
continue five to 10 years from now." 

        Cal Poly Pomona received a $6.3 million TQE/Teacher PREP grant in 2004 to create and implement 
a comprehensive model of reform to improve the preparation of teachers for the challenges of the region's 
diverse K-12 classrooms. One of the grant's goals is to equip administrators with leadership strategies to

                  To Kill a Mockingbird Topic of Events in October and November 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  July 7, 2008  Dust off those reading glasses! Cal Poly Pomona today 
announced that it has received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) to host The Big 
Read in Pomona this fall.  

        The Big Read gives communities the opportunity to come together to read, discuss and celebrate 
one of 23 selections from American and world literature. The Big Read in Pomona will focus on Harper 
Lees Pulitzer Prize-winning novel To Kill a Mockingbird through a series of events in October and 
November. Last year, The Big Read in Pomona encouraged thousands to pick up Bless Me, Ultima. 

        We are hopeful that Harper Lees To Kill A Mockingbird will be a catalyst to bring people together 
around the broad themes of tolerance and justice that are prevalent in the book, said Jonnie Owens, 
director of community outreach for the College of Letters, Arts & Social Sciences, who will oversee the use 
of the grant. As our community reads, we hope they will not only find pleasure in that reading but also 
enlightenment and the ability to understand and get along with each other.  

        The Big Read in Pomona will launch with a kickoff event Friday, Oct. 3, at the Cal Poly Pomona 
Downtown Center, 300 W. Second St. in the Pomona Arts Colony. Details about upcoming events will be 
released later this summer. 

        Cal Poly Pomona is one of 208 organizations across the country hosting The Big Read events this 
fall and winter. As a recipient of a $17,000 Big Read grant, Cal Poly Pomona along with community leaders 
and partnering organizations will provide community-based reading programs. Activities include read-a-

Institute of Museum and Library Services and Arts Midwest. 

        Modeled on successful city reads programs, the Big Read is meant to address the national decline 
in literary reading as documented in the NEA's 2004 landmark survey Reading at Risk: A Survey of Literary 
Reading in America. The survey showed that less than half the American adult population now reads 
literature.  

        To date, the NEA has given more than 500 grants to support local Big Read projects. 

        Everything the NEA does we do in partnership. I am delighted to announce our 208 new partners 
in The Big Read. Some are new to the program, some are returning, but all of them have answered the call 
to action to get our country reading again, said NEA Chairman Dana Gioia.

          Cal Poly Universities 2009 Rose Float Design Unveiled 
         

        POMONA, Calif.  July 17, 2008  The Cal Poly universities in Pomona and San Luis Obispo will 
                                                                                                         st
warm up New Years Day with beach fun and games in Seaside Amusement, the universities 61  entry 
           th
for the 120  Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena. 

        The two universities recently unveiled the rendering, which is the brainchild of Cal Poly SLO 

student Shawna Swanson, the campus Rose Float design leader. A fifth year art and design student, 

Swanson will receive $1000 as a cash prize for her idea.  

        Her design was chosen among 80 entries from the February 2008 contest. Students from both 

campus Rose Float committees met to review and vote on all of the submitted entries. The design was a 

hit among the committee because of its fun nature and its level of creativity and difficulty.  

        A fun, lively and whimsical seaside boardwalk featuring an assortment of amusement rides and 

attractions will represent the sister universities Rose Float in the 2009 parade themed Hats Off to 

Entertainment. The float will include a rollercoaster, Ferris wheel, parachute drop, game, food and ticket 

booths, carousel horses and bumper cars.  

        Several elements of this years float are planned to be animated, including the roller coaster, Ferris 

wheel and parachute drop. Other exciting elements include an old-fashioned organ at the rear of the float 

that will shoot bursts of smoke and bubbles. Additionally, a playlist of songs will emanate from the organ to 

amuse parade goers.  

        The entry will also incorporate satellite vehicles in which two bumper cars circling the float will be 

driven by students from both campuses.

        Swansons inspiration for Seaside Amusement stems from her love of amusement parks, 
especially the ones that once lined the Pacific coast.  

        Spending a day by the beach in the sun, eating fried foods and riding roller coasters is my idea of 
entertainment, says the Concord resident. The message behind [this entry] is the importance of taking 
time out for a little fun in the sun.  

        She adds that the design is reflective of the history of boardwalk parks and the fact that many 
people still enjoy them today.  

        Rose Float committee students from both campuses were so compelled by the design that they 
took a road trip to Santa Cruz to research the elements of classic West Coast boardwalks.  

        Construction on some of the larger elements, such as the Ferris wheel and parachute drop are 
under way. A majority of framing and construction will be done during the summer months.  

        This years theme, Hats Off to Entertainment, was conjured by Ronald Corky Conzonire, the 
2009 president of the Tournament of Roses Parade.  

        Students from the Cal Poly Universities have designed, constructed, decorated and financed entries 
in the Tournament of Roses Parade every year since 1949. Over the years, the floats have received 45 
awards, including nine Founders trophies for the best volunteer-built float.

                          Program is Seventh in West, Most Diverse in Nation 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  July 24, 2008  Cal Poly Pomonas Urban and Regional Planning graduate 
program has been selected as one of the best in the nation by Planetizen, the leading online publication for 
the urban planning, design and development community.  

        When compared against prominent Ivy Leagues, private and public institutions around the nation, 
Cal Poly Pomonas Urban and Regional Planning graduate program received outstanding rankings in a

        Cal Poly Pomona ranked second in the nation among programs without a Ph.D. When weighed side 
by side with universities that also grant doctorate degrees, Cal Poly Pomona ranked seventh in the Western 
United States.  

        The publication also asked those who are practicing urban planning their opinions of graduate 
                                                                                                 st

by Financial Aid per Student (as proportion of tuition), Cal Poly Pomona ranked third.  

         The Department of Urban and Regional Planning is delighted that its innovative masters program 
has been recognized, said Dr. Richard Willson, department chair. Willson added that he is particularly 
proud that this is the only program in the top 25 that also offers its core courses in the evening, allowing 
students to work in planning while attaining their degree. 

         Planetizen evaluated urban planning programs across the country and in Canada for the 2009 
edition of the Planetizen Guide to Graduate Urban Planning Programs.  

         Planetizens rankings are based on a combination of statistical and opinion data. To gather 
statistical data, Planetizen sent surveys to more than 100 institutions with masters programs in urban 
planning, requesting data on such measures as incoming student GPA, faculty publications and financial 
aid. To gather opinion data about programs, it sent surveys to a selected sample of planning educators and 
practitioners and asked them to rate masters programs in urban planning on a scale of 1 to 7.

                     Cal Poly Pomona Names Interim Dean for  
                             College of Environmental Design 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  August 14, 2008  Kyle D. Brown, director of the John T. Lyle Center for 
Regenerative Studies and professor of Landscape Architecture, has been appointed interim dean of Cal Poly 
Pomonas College of Environmental Design. 

         A leading expert in the integration of environmental sustainability and social justice, Brown has 
served as the director of the Lyle Center since 2004. He is also the co-chair of the President's Climate Task 
Force, whose goal is to achieve climate neutrality on campus. 

         "I am honored by the confidence of my faculty colleagues and the university leadership," said 
Brown. "These are important times for the entire environmental design community, and I look forward to 
collaborating with everyone on the issues that enhance our ability to support our students." 

         Brown came to Cal Poly Pomona in 1998 as an assistant professor in the Landscape Architecture 
department. During his tenure, he has led research efforts in sustainable shelter design and serves as 
principal investigator of Habitat 21, which develops, implements and evaluates sustainable settlement 
strategies in disenfranchised communities in developing nations. In addition, he advises numerous student-
driven landscape planning and design projects that engage local communities and propose visionary yet 
practical solutions. 

         "This will be a great fit for the College of Environmental Design," said interim provost Herman 
Lujan. "Kyle has proven himself at the Lyle Center, and that experience should segue well into the interim 
dean's position."

        POMONA, Calif.  August 18, 2008  Cal Poly Pomona professor Dr. Renford Reese often 
imparts his knowledge to others through lectures, books and articles. Beginning this summer, the political 
science professor is adding coffee cups to his list of media.  

        Starbucks Coffee Company has begun printing 8 ounce cups featuring a quote from Reeses latest 
book American Bravado (Inkwater Press, 2007). Reeses quote appears in The Way I See It #294: 
Insensitivity makes arrogance ugly; empathy is what makes humility beautiful.  

        Starbucks The Way I See It series provides a collection of thoughts, opinions and expressions from 
notable figures to help spark discussion. Other recent quotables have been #273 Gen. Colin L. Powell, #268 
musician Josh Groban, and #258 Pulitzer Prize-winning author George F. Will.  

        Reese submitted his quote for consideration for The Way I See It series two years ago. Earlier this 
year he learned his quote was selected for print on millions of cups.  

        This has been amazing. Someone sent me a photo of the cup from a Starbucks in Toronto, said 
Reese. In one way, my quote being on Starbucks cups is validation. Authors want to be widely read. In the 
extremely competitive area of publishing it is difficult to connect with the masses via ones writings. I think 
it's ironic that a couple hundred people will read a book that I worked on for two years and millions of 
people will read a quote that I contemplated for less than five minutes. Life continues to be funny. 

        Reese is a professor in the political science department at Cal Poly Pomona. In addition to 
American Bravado, he penned Prison Race (2006), Leadership in the LAPD: Walking the Tightrope (2005), 
and American Paradox: Young Black Men (2004).

                         On Future Use of the River Parkways 

     Sept. 2 Workshop Address L.A. River, San Gabriel River, Arroyo Seco and Eaton Wash 
 

        POMONA, Calif.  August 28, 2008  Southern California residents often see their waterways as 
a giant sewer system of concrete channels. But what most people dont realize is that the Los Angeles 
Basin has real rivers running through it. Although the Los Angeles River, San Gabriel River, Arroyo Seco and 
Eaton Wash no longer resemble the natural waterways that supported the founding of this metropolitan 
region, restoration plans are in the works. 

        Through the Golden Necklace Project, students in Cal Poly Pomonas Department of Urban and 
Regional Planning (URP) are educating Southern Californians on the rivers positive impact on the quality of 
life in their communities, whether as recreational and transportation corridors, or in maintaining the health 
of the watershed. 

        On Tuesday, Sept. 2,  students in URPs Community Planning Studio, taught by Associate Professor 
Julianna Delgado, will lead a workshop at the Los Angeles River Center and Garden to develop guiding 
principles for the next phase of the Golden Necklace Project. Attendees will walk to the LA River and see 
its relationship to the surrounding residential, commercial and industrial neighborhoods. Government 
officials, city planners and representatives from various outdoors organizations have been invited.  

        Visiting the river allows people to understand the importance of the Los Angeles River and 
envision its potential as open space, Delgado says. Workshop participants will also work together to 
develop a set of Golden Principles that all stakeholders can embrace and will lead to an implementation

strategy for the Golden Necklace multi-use trail way. 

        The Golden Necklace project started in January 2008 and envisions a long distance route that 
connects the San Gabriel Mountains to the ocean in Long Beach, via a grand loop or golden necklace. 
Along with creating much needed recreation space for pedestrians, bikers and equestrians, the project 
provides educational opportunities to increase awareness about the watershed and importance of the 
regions precious water supply. Of course, the open space brings a welcome transit alternative in a time of 
skyrocketing gas prices and constant traffic jams. 

        Organized by students, the workshop is part of a two-quarter capstone course for graduating 
seniors to apply what theyve learned in a real-life, community service learning project. The event is a 
public-private effort among the university, non-profit and corporate sponsors. Supporters include the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy, Arroyo Seco Foundation, Rivers and Mountains Conservancy, Starbucks, 
Trader Joes and Whole Foods. 

        The workshop is on Tuesday, Sept. 2 from 6 to 9 p.m. at the LA River Center in Los Angeles and is 
free to attend. Please RSVP by e-mailing goldennecklace@gmail.com. For more information, visit

                      First Batch of Zinfandel for Private Label 

    Grapes grown from prize-winning Zinfandel cuttings from historic De Ambrogio Ranch 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  August 28, 2008  After seven years of nurturing historic Zinfandel cuttings 
into a vineyard, Cal Poly Pomona has harvested its first Zinfandel grapes to make a private label wine. 

        Six students and staff spent eight long hours on Thursday, Aug. 28, harvesting 4.34 tons of 
Zinfandel wine grapes from two campus vineyards.  The grapes were immediately trucked to South Coast 
Winery in Temecula, where they will be crushed, fermented and bottled as white Zinfandel.  

        This is historic, said College of Agriculture Dean Les Young. Were not winemakers, so this is all 
new to us. It took 7 years of trial and tribulation, but now were truly enjoying the fruits of our labor. 

        The trial Young refers to is the long process of acquiring the prize-winning Zinfandel cuttings and 
nurturing the grapes to have the right levels of sugar and acid for wine.  

        The Zinfandel cuttings were from Don Galleano, who combed the fields in Rancho Cucamonga and 
selected 400 grapevine cuttings, some of them nearly 100 years old, from the De Ambrogio Ranch vineyard 
just before it was razed for development. These Zinfandels were then potted in Cal Poly Pomona's nursery 
with the hope of maintaining a small piece of the Cucamonga Valley's rich wine-producing history. 

        "We wanted to take these prized cuttings from the De Ambrogio Ranch, which represents a lot of 
the history of the Cucamonga Valley, and preserve them for future generations," says Galleano, a third-
generation vintner who operates the Galleano Winery in Mira Loma and Galleano Enterprises, the largest 
shipper of grapes in Southern California.  

        Today, the old-line Zinfandel cuttings from De Ambrogio Ranch, which have won multiple gold

medals in international wine competitions, are part of the university's new viticulture program.  

        "Grapes are the second-largest agricultural commodity in the state, and we didn't have a single 
grapevine on this campus," said Dan Hostetler, a professor and chair of the Plant Sciences department. "A 
lot of our students are getting jobs in viticulture or consulting to vineyards, and we wanted to create a 
hands-on lab in that area." 

        The cuttings were grafted to three acres of root stock planted on campus.  

        Each step of the way, students have done the bulk of the work, plowing the field, tending the 
cuttings in the nursery and grafting them to the roots. 

        Junior horticulture major Tim Crane was harvesting Zinfandel alongside graduate plant sciences 
student Paul Nurre on Aug. 28.  

        I wanted to do it so I could learn about the grapes up close, said Crane. Im really interested in 
viniculture so Ive been nagging Paul with questions all day. Its just so effective to learn this way because 
you get your hands right in there. I was learning about Pierces disease and then saw it up close.

contributed to the project. Alumnus Don Hendrickson of Hendrickson Brothers Irrigation designed the 
watering system; California Grapevine Nursery contributed the root stocks; and Galleano, who managed the 
Di Ambrogio Ranch, donated the historic cuttings. Geyser Peak Winery, which has used De Ambrogio 
grapes in their own wines, helped get the project going with financial backing. The winery has offered to 
help bottle the university's wine when it's ready.  

        In the future, the department of Plant Sciences and the College of Agriculture hope to partner with 
the Collins College of Hospitality Management to provide new coursework and programs on winemaking, 
grape production and wine marketing.

            Cal Poly Pomona Offers New Certificate Program for  
                      Six Sigma Business Management Strategy 

                       Program Helps Businesses Streamline Their Processes 
 

        POMONA, Calif.  September 8, 2008  The Inland Empire is poised to become the states inland 
transportation capital. With freight demand expected to increase 67 percent by 2020, learning 
manufacturing and supply chain management will be vital.  

        In anticipation of this transportation boom, Cal Poly Pomonas College of the Extended University 
(CEU) is positioning itself to become a leader in education for manufacturing, supply chain and logistics 
business professionals.  

        This fall, the Cal Poly Pomona CEU will offer a new certificate program for the Six Sigma Program, 
a business management strategy. Originally developed by the Motorola Corporation and widely used in 
many industry sectors, Six Sigma seeks, identifies and removes causes of defects and errors in 
manufacturing and business processes. Applying Six Sigma tools within a company has been shown to 
reduce variation, improve processes and increase profits.  

        The non-credit Six Sigma certificate program will include Introduction to Six Sigma for Managers, 
an eight-hour online course in which participants will learn critical success factors in the implementation of 
Six Sigma within their organization. They will also learn the strategies and benefits of Six Sigma that can 
lead to organizational cost savings.  

        Beginning Saturday, Sept. 13, the CEU will offer Six Sigma Green Belt: Manufacturing. This course 
is intended for individuals with a manufacturing background and will focus solely on how Six Sigma applies

to manufacturing. Students will learn how to appropriately apply Six Sigma tools, increasing efficiency in 
business processes. They will learn methodology and data collection techniques for eliminating process 
deficiencies and statistical methods to quantify results of each process. Classes will be held at Cal Poly 
Pomona on Saturdays and Tuesdays, Sept. 13 through Oct. 11. 

        The College of the Extended University will also offer a certificate program in Supply Chain 
Management. The overview course will be held Friday, Oct. 10 and 24.  

        With a booming population and rapid growth in construction, manufacturing and transportation, the 
Inland Empire is one of Californias fastest changing regions. Despite the current downturn in the housing 
market, the Inland Empire still experiences growth in manufacturing, and commercial markets offset the 
weakness in residential real estate. In fact, Victor Valley, which includes the cities of Victorville, Hesperia 
and Apple Valley, is now the home of the Southern California Logistics Airport (SCLA). The strategic plan for 
the SCLA is to make the region the distribution hub of the country.

     Great Leaders for Great Schools Institute at Cal Poly Pomona 

                                Awarded $2.5 Million Grant  

        Pomona, Calif. -- In collaboration with the Pomona Unified School District, the Great Leaders for 
Great Schools Institute at Cal Poly Pomona has been awarded a five-year, $2.5 million grant from the U.S. 
Department of Education. The grant, which was recently announced by Rep. Grace Napolitano, D- Santa Fe 
Springs, will improve the work of K-12 administrators in public schools. 
         Under the universitys College of Education & Integrative Studies, the Great Leaders for Great 
Schools Institute gives new administrators in underperforming urban schools additional resources to 
support teaching and learning. The Institute also encourages policy development and scholarly research in 
the field of educational leadership. 
         Beginning summer 2009, the Institute and Pomona Unified will train a total of 30 new school 
administrators through the School Leadership Development program. The program will prepare the 
administrators with leadership skills to handle the challenges of turning around underperforming urban 
schools in the district and eventually in the greater San Gabriel Valley.  
         "This kind of program is long overdue," said Stephen Davis, professor of educational leadership 
and the grant's administrator. "It is a unique program that tailors and centers its curriculum around Pomona 
Unified's specific needs, rather than a one-size-fits-all kind of training."   
         Modeled after similar programs in New York City schools, Delta State University and New Leaders 
for New Schools, a nonprofit organization, the program will be framed around a full-time, site-based 
apprenticeship and an innovative curriculum that emphasizes problem solving. With an emphasis on hands-
on learning, each participant will be placed under the direction of a trained mentor principal who will 
provide individualized guidance and feedback on a daily basis. 
        The program will also provide graduates who are appointed to administrative positions in Pomona 
Unified with a year of follow-up, including executive coaching and topical seminars designed to sharpen 
management skills and support the transition from the classroom to administration.

                       Cal Poly Pomona Begins Shuttle Service  
                         to Pomona North Metrolink Sept. 22 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  September 17, 2008  As part of Cal Poly Pomonas commitment to the 
environment, the university will launch a free shuttle service to and from the Pomona North Metrolink 
station this fall. The Bronco Link shuttle, which is powered by compressed natural gas, will encourage the 
campus community to use public transportation and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 

        Beginning Monday, Sept. 22 , the Bronco Link shuttle will pick up faculty, staff and students from 
the Pomona North station in the morning and drop them off in the evening. The shuttle will make two stops 
on campus -- in front of the CLA Building and in front of Building 1.  

        "We are very excited to introduce the Bronco Link shuttle from the Pomona North Metrolink station 
to campus. It should make it even easier for all of us to join the carbon neutrality movement by using public 
transportation rather than driving to campus," says Doug Freer, vice president of student affairs. 

        Currently, there is no direct bus route from the campus to the Pomona North Metrolink station at 
205 Santa Fe St. in Pomona. Train passengers who get off at that station must ride two buses to campus, 
which may take as long as 50 minutes. Other Metrolink stops, such as the Pomona Downtown or the 
Claremont stations, have public buses that stop just off campus but also make other stops along the way. 

        Last spring, the Rideshare office surveyed the campus on the possibility of a direct shuttle, and 
about 800 people said they would be very interested in it. From those responses, the Pomona North station 
was chosen to best serve the needs of the campus.  

         "Although we are starting out by serving the Pomona North station, our goal is to expand the

service to meet more trains during peak times as well as providing service from other Metrolink stations," 
says Glenn Shenker, interim director of Parking and Transportation Services. "We are pleased that this 
initiative falls in line with President Ortiz's Climate Commitment pledge for the campus to become carbon 
neutral." 

         On weekday mornings, the Bronco Link will pick up commuters from Pomona North at 6:55 a.m. 
and again at 7:35 a.m. Trains from San Bernardino arrive at the station at 6:52 a.m. and 7:32 a.m. and from 
Los Angeles at 6:53 a.m. In the evenings, the shuttle will pick up passengers from the Building 1 and the 
CLA building at 5:05 p.m. and 6:05 p.m. and arrive at Pomona North at 5:22 p.m. and 6:22 p.m. Trains going 
to San Bernardino leave at 5:45 p.m. and 6:25 p.m. and to Los Angeles at 5:37 p.m.  

         The nonstop, 6.4-mile trip from to and from the Metrolink station takes about 15 minutes.  

         The shuttle will run on compressed natural gas (CNG), a relatively low cost, odorless and non-
corrosive form of fuel. As a cleaner burning fuel, CNG-powered vehicles produce about 80 percent less 
ozone-forming emissions compared to gasoline vehicles. 

         Bronco Link is free to students, staff and faculty who show their Bronco ID. The Rideshare Office 
also offers Metrolink reimbursements up to $90 a month for faculty and staff. Full-time students can get a 
25 percent discount off monthly passes and 10-trip tickets.

        Cal Poly Pomona Awards Presidents Council Scholarships  
                                To Universitys Top Students 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  September 24, 2008  Cal Poly Pomona recognized some of the universitys 
                                                                                                     th
brightest students with Presidents Council Scholarships on Wednesday, Sept. 24. Now in its 25  year, the 
President's Council Scholars program is considered the most prestigious scholarship series at the 
university.  

        The program awards a select group of students based on academic and co-curricular excellence. 
This year, 26 students representing all of the academic colleges have been awarded $2,500 each. 

        The students represent a broad range of experiences and interests. One is a former Army Ranger 
who received a Purple Heart after being seriously injured by a suicide bomber in Iraq. Another is 
responsible for organizing the universitys largest annual community event, the Pumpkin Festival. Their 
goals include becoming an astronaut, engineer, teacher, biologist, financial analyst, lawyer, professor, 
composer, urban planner, and more.  

        Each of the endowed scholarships is named by its benefactor. The Presidents Council is a group of 
business and community leaders who excel in their professional fields and demonstrate a record of public 
service. The council has played an active role in improving educational, cultural and social life at the 
university. The council serves as the major support group for the president and brings university concerns to 
the attention of civic, government, and business leaders throughout the region and the state. 

        This year's recipients and their benefactors include:

                    Cal Poly Pomona Awarded $178,000 Grant  
                                    to Better Catalogue Cells 
 
        POMONA, Calif. The National Science Foundation has awarded Cal Poly Pomona a $178,000 
grant over two years to improve the way cells and their components can be separated and identified.   
        Dr. Timothy Corcoran (chemistry), Dr. Hossein Ahmadzadeh (chemistry) and Dr. Amar Raheja 
(computer science) began working together this summer to develop a technique called Supercontinuum 
Rapid Excitation-Emission Matrix, also known as ScREEM, to effectively catalogue cells and their 
components.  
        ScREEM is a fluorescent detection method that facilitates the separation and identification of the 
contents of a cell, similar to sorting a large basket of laundry. The task could be easier if the laundry load 
was pre-sorted. In this case, cell contents flow down a tiny glass pipe in the presence of an electric field, in 
a process called capillary electrophoresis. The fluorescent probe tags are added which bind to selected bio-
molecules present in the cell contents. The new instrument allows simultaneous monitoring of fluorescence 
from a wide variety of different colored tags.  
        This cell-by-cell, piece by piece, protein-by-protein level of detail has not been previously 
obtainable. This process could ultimately lead to increased efficiency in research and the ability to 
fundamentally ask new questions in a broad range of research. The technique may also be adapted to other 
separation techniques and detection methods in biology.  
        The Cal Poly Pomona team, including Dr. Robert Talmadge (biology)  plans to demonstrate this 
method by examining the mitochondria  the powerhouses of a cell  in single muscle cells.  

        Four undergraduate chemistry students are currently working on the research.

         The students involved in this work take a highly hands-on approach to developing methods and 
instruments that may make a global impact, said Corcoran. These experiences prepare and equip them to 

be future leaders in science and engineering.  

         Corcoran, a physical chemist and laser specialist, is the principal investigator. He leads the team in 
the development of the optics and hardware for the laser detection system; their prototype is nearly 
complete. The sampling and separation aspects, which have already been assembled, were created using 
Ahmadzadehs expertise in analytical chemistry and capillary electrophoresis. In addition, Raheja, a 
computer science specialist, and his students are creating data analysis software to collect and process the 
large volumes of data the ScREEM detector camera will produce. Talmadge will contribute to the 
mitochodria work and cell sampling.

                       $4.1 Million Grant to Cal Poly Pomona  
   Smoothes Bumps on the Road to a Degree in STEM Disciplines 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  October 17, 2008  The U.S. Department of Education has provided Cal Poly 
Pomona with a $4.1 million grant to help the university address the national shortage of professionals ready 
to enter the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).  

        This funding was made available through the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007, 
which has been said to provide the single largest increase in college aid since the GI bill, including $200 
million of support to Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). Congresswoman Grace Napolitano (D-38), formerly 
chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, in whose district the university is located, was a strong 
advocate of the CCRAA legislation and provided valuable encouragement and support for the campuss 
application.  Cal Poly Pomona was one of only two universities in California to receive an individual award 
from the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. 

        The two-year grant will help Cal Poly Pomona build a STEM Pipeline to make the journey as smooth 
as possible for high school students to earn a degree and enter the workforce, particularly in the STEM 
disciplines. While the funding is intended to support Hispanic and low-income students in STEM 
disciplines, building the pipeline paves the way for all future students to enjoy new equipment, technology 
and streamlined processes.  

        By approaching this problem from many angles, I think we can raise the number of students who 
are graduating, both those coming directly from high school and from community colleges, particularly 
Hispanic students in the STEM disciplines, said Dr. Claudia Pinter-Lucke, principal investigator of the grant 
and associate vice president of undergraduate studies. Weve been working to address these major 
issues. Especially in light of our current California economy, the much-needed support of this grant will help 
us make a difference even faster.  

        The multifaceted project has several approaches:

    •   Build a Formal STEM Faculty Learning Community.       Best practices in teaching and learning in the 
        STEM disciplines will be the center of a learning community made up of STEM educators from Cal 
        Poly Pomona, high schools and community colleges. Summer Institutes for Teachers, an annual 
        conference and a new website will bring all of the entities together to share best practices in 
        teaching and learning in the STEM disciplines.  
    •   Enhance STEM Counseling for Community College Students.         Counseling for transfer students in 
        STEM areas needs to be specialized because STEM requirements tend to be sequential, making the 
        path to graduation significantly different than for other majors. A new STEM counselor position will 
        be created at Cal Poly Pomona. The counselor will develop a comprehensive approach to advising 
        Riverside Community College (RCC) STEM students.  A new feature in that approach is software to 
        make an individualized study plan, including course work from the community college and Cal Poly 
        Pomona.  
    •   Create a Seamless Transfer Process.   Because community colleges in the area are semester 
        campuses and Cal Poly Pomona is a quarter campus, some courses cannot be transferred easily and 
        students often find themselves repeating parts of courses. Cal Poly Pomona will work with 
        community colleges to line up course requirements, and develop online modules as necessary to fill 
        in any holes. Riverside Community College will be the first to participate in the program, with plans 
        for expansion to other community colleges. 
    •   Prepare Students for the Baccalaureate.   The university will introduce engineering and other 
        STEM fields to students at high schools and Riverside Community College. Through project-based, 
        hands-on experiences, students can become familiar with and interested in the STEM disciplines 
        early. As Riverside Community College students prepare to transfer to CPP, they will attend a Cal 
        Poly Pomona faculty lecture series, which will include STEM topics as well as general orientation 
        information.  
    •   Prepare Students for the Future.   The university will also better prepare future STEM 
        professionals with technology upgrades, expanded tutoring services and an undergraduate 
        research apprentice program.

              Cal Poly Pomona Landscape Architecture Students  
               Bring Home Honors in International Competition 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  October 28, 2008  Cal Poly Pomona's landscape architecture students 
captured five awards in the 2008 Student Awards competition hosted by the American Society of 
Landscape Architecture. The department won more awards than any other university in the prestigious 
international competition, outperforming Harvard University Graduate School of Design and University of 
Pennsylvania School of Design.  

         The university received an Award of Excellence and two Honor Awards in the analysis and 
planning category. In the communications category, students also won an Award of Excellence and an 
Honor Award. 

         "Our students won an impressive 25 percent of the total awards given out this year. Two of the 
five were Awards of Excellence, which are not given out every year and honor only exceptional projects," 
says Jerry Taylor, interim chair of the Landscape Architecture department. "The quality of our students and 
faculty advisers is truly outstanding." 

         In one project, four students proposed a revitalization plan for a dilapidated area in South Los 
Angeles that includes improvements to back alleys, vacant lots and an industrial park, as well as 
introducing a new open-air market. Judges remarked that the project demonstrated "professional quality" 
analysis and could be used as a model to revive similar neighborhoods. 

         Another student project developed a new waste management system for two small desert cities 
that would significantly reduce their dependence on landfills. The plan calls for the cities of Shoshone and 
Tecopa, both in Inyo County, to compost and recycle much of their waste, and use pigs to reduce the

          "Students look at important issues in the world, issues that are a challenge in society," says Susan 

Mulley, assistant professor of landscape architecture. "They try to come up with real solutions that people 

can use." 

          Other winning projects included the preservation of Chollas Creek in San Diego, the student-

produced SUBSURFACE magazine and a film titled "Shoshone, CA," which documents the design process of 

landscape architecture students.

            What Happens During a 7.8 Magnitude Earthquake?                                          

                                Cal Poly Pomona Hosts Safety Fair and Lecture  
                                 to Help Community Prepare for Emergencies       
         
        POMONA, Calif.  October 31, 2008  On Nov. 4, Cal Poly Pomona will help the community 
prepare for an emergency with a safety fair and presentation on what Southern Californians can expect 
from a major earthquake. Both events build up to the Nov. 13 Great Southern California ShakeOut, a test of 
the regions ability to withstand a catastrophic earthquake. 
        Beginning at noon on Nov. 4, Dr. Ken Hudnut of the U.S. Geological Survey will discuss ShakeOut: 
The Great Southern California Earthquake. The lecture will help participants understand the impact of a 
7.8 magnitude earthquake if it hits the southern San Andreas Fault. Experts consider a massive earthquake 
like this inevitable, and powerful enough to cause strong shaking throughout Southern California. 
Sponsored by the geological sciences department, the event will be held in the Bronco Bookstore Building 
(66), Room 202.  
        Scheduled in conjunction with the lecture is an Emergency and Safety Awareness Expo. The Expo 
will provide education on how individuals can protect themselves, their families and their data in the event 
of a disaster. The expo, set to run from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Nov. 4 in the Bronco Bookstore Atrium, 
features informational booths, preparedness supplies and First-Aid information. 
        The Great Southern California ShakeOut is part of a statewide emergency drill and is 
unprecedented in scope. All individuals, private organizations and government agencies will be asked to 
drop, cover and hold on at 10 a.m. on Nov. 13. At Cal Poly Pomona, building marshals and floor captains 
will lead the earthquake drill so that participants can practice acting quickly to protect themselves. 
        Cal Poly Pomona is at 3801 W. Temple Ave. in Pomona. Parking permits may be obtained for $5 at 
the Visitor Information Booth along Kellogg Drive. For more information, call Debbi McFall at (909) 869-6981.

        Fires start all the time, but they seldom turn into the kind of holocaust we have seen, he says. 
Its a result of two things: dry vegetation and strong, dry winds. You cant stop chaparral fires from 
happening, but you can reduce the risk of your home catching fire.  

        Wildfires are a natural part of this regions ecosystem, says Quinn. Its essential for people who 
choose to live close to nature to be fully informed about the inherent fire risk to a home when it is near 
highly flammable chaparral. 

        Homeowners should carefully consider items they put near their home, he warns. Things like 
wooden decks, fire wood, wood sheds and fuel tanks could easily be ignited by flying embers. Landscape

choices also should serve as a barrier to fires rather than as fuel. A popular example is the use of succulent 

plants (like cacti, aloes, and yuccas), which are low maintenance as well as fire and drought resistant. 

         One of the easiest tips is also free: Be prepared with an evacuation plan.

    Zinfandel Rosé Available for $14 at Universitys Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch Next Week 
 

        POMONA, Calif.  November 20, 2008 Cal Poly Pomona is preparing to unveil its private label 
wine, Horsehill Vineyards, in time for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays.  

        The rosé wine features grapes grown from prize-winning Zinfandel cuttings from the historic De 
Ambrogio Ranch in Rancho Cucamonga.  

        The inaugural vintage is ready for bottling at South Coast Winery in Temecula, under the direction 
of master winemaker Jon McPherson, on Nov. 20 at 1:45 p.m. The wine will be available for $14 a bottle or 
$152 for a case of 12 beginning next week at the universitys student-run Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch.  

        This rosé is beautifully vibrant, almost neon pink, with light lavender edges, McPherson says of 
the wine. The aroma is full of exotic fruit characters:  cherries, watermelon and strawberry, all very showy 
and candy-like.  The flavors mimic what the eye and nose behold--crisp fruit flavors that border on sour 
cherry, sweet watermelon and light strawberry. The first sip is light and refreshing, certainly an invitation 
for that second and third sip. Nicely balanced and definitely not too sweet, this juicy rosé is perfect for 
those holiday gatherings and get togethers.

        Cal Poly Pomonas College of Agriculture and The Collins College of Hospitality Management have

        During the local wine industrys heyday in the 1940s, the Cucamonga Valley floor was covered with 
40,000 acres of vineyards. Early settlers recognized since the mid-1800s that the region's sandy soil and 
favorable climate would promise dependable harvests.  

        Before De Ambrogio Ranch was razed for development in 2001, Don Galleano combed the fields 
and selected 400 grapevine cuttings, some of them nearly 100 years old.  

        "We wanted to take these prized cuttings from the De Ambrogio Ranch, which represents a lot of 
the history of the Cucamonga Valley, and preserve them for future generations," says Galleano, a third-
generation vintner who operates the Galleano Winery in Mira Loma and Galleano Enterprises, the largest 
shipper of grapes in Southern California. 

        With help from Cal Poly Pomona faculty, the Zinfandel cuttings were potted in the universitys 
nursery with the hope of maintaining a small piece of the areas wine-producing history. They also 
represented an opportunity for the universitys College of Agriculture and The Collins College of Hospitality 
Management to cultivate new programs for students to explore the agriculture and business aspects of the 
wine industry.  

        "Grapes are the second-largest agricultural commodity in the state, and we didn't have a single 
grapevine on this campus," said Dan Hostetler, a professor and chair of the Plant Sciences department in 
the College of Agriculture. "A lot of our students are getting jobs in viticulture or consulting to vineyards, 
and we wanted to create a hands-on lab in that area." 

        Faculty, staff and students from Agricultures plant sciences department have cultivated and 
harvested the grapes. Each step of the way, students had hands-on learning experiences, plowing the field, 
tending the cuttings in the nursery and grafting them to more than three acres of root stock planted on 
campus.  

        The long process of acquiring the prize-winning Zinfandel cuttings and nurturing the grapes so they 
have the right levels of sugar and acid for wine resulted in the first harvest of wine-ready grapes this 
August. 

        At The Collins College, faculty has worked with local wineries to make the wine. Hospitality

management students also will become involved in the wine marketing component of Horsehill Vineyards 
through a beverage marketing class taught by associate professor Margie Ferree Jones. 

        Were anxious to provide these kinds of professional avenues for students interested in the wine 
business. The experience of making our own wine gives students a real product to touch and strategies to 
consider, says Jones, whose experience with wine, marketing and hospitality made her a natural 
coordinator of the enterprise at The Collins College. Horsehill Vineyards is also kind of fun. Well have 
something to celebrate each year with each vintage. And through this wine, our community and alumni can 
connect with us  even at the dinner table.  

        An essential aspect of the program is partnerships. In addition to Galleanos donations, the project 
has benefited from two California Lottery grants totaling $50,000; alumnus Don Hendrickson of Hendrickson 
Brothers Irrigation designed the vineyards watering system; and California Grapevine Nursery contributed 
the root stocks.  

        Master Winemaker Jon McPherson of South Coast Winery in Temecula will oversee the crushing, 
fermentation and bottling of the Zinfandel rosé wine. Galleano also will make a limited production of red 
Zinfandel.  

        Horsehill Vineyards, named for the location of the vines on campus, will be served this holiday 
season in the universitys Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch. Proceeds from the wine will support future grape 
harvests and a vegetable garden project spearheaded by the two colleges. 

        South Coast Winery is located at 34843 Rancho California Road in Temecula.

                               Anti-Drunk Driving Campaign 
 
        POMONA, Calif.  Drinking by college-age students is estimated to contribute to 1,700 alcohol-

related injury deaths (mostly car crashes) and 600,000 nonfatal injuries each year.  

        Cal Poly Pomonas University Police Department has joined 100 other state law enforcement 

agencies to help curb drunken driving. Beginning Dec. 12, they will take part in an aggressive winter holiday 

DUI enforcement campaign through the new year. Additional officers and deputies throughout the county 

will be conducting checkpoints as well as specialized patrols looking for DUI drivers.   

        Their efforts will be supported by $7 million in grants over three years from the Office of Traffic 

Safety. The grant funds prevention and enforcement measures such as educational events, sobriety 

checkpoints and designated DUI patrols in the area.  

        Were concentrating enforcement efforts all around the campus community, and we will be

                    Carol and Jim Collins Pledge $5.25 Million  
                     to Jump-Start Donations for Expansion of  
                       The Collins College at Cal Poly Pomona 
                                                         

        POMONA, Calif.  Carol and Jim Collins, the namesakes and primary benefactors of The Collins 
College of Hospitality Management, have once again shown tremendous generosity to Cal Poly Pomona. 
They have pledged to match dollar-for-dollar $5 million in donations for a $10 million academic building. 

        Carol and Jim have been wonderful friends of the university. They are visionary people who have 
been pivotal in making The Collins College a national leader in hospitality management education. Their 
latest gift will be transformational, creating new opportunities for the next generation of hospitality 
professionals while empowering others to support The Collins College, said Cal Poly Pomona President 
Michael Ortiz.  

        The building will employ green building design and lay the foundation for expanded programs at 
The Collins College, which has seen a 46% growth in enrollment in only three years. Future graduates are 
well positioned to fill the hospitality industrys call for more skilled professionals. The Collins College is 
also developing the states first graduate program in hospitality management, reinforcing its forward-
thinking reputation in the industry.  

        Carol and I want to see this dollar-for-dollar challenge invigorate a broad base of alumni and 
industry support, Jim Collins said. The Collins College is a premier hospitality management program, and 
it needs our support to continue to grow and make an impact on students and the hospitality industry.  

        For over 20 years, Carol and Jim Collins have donated substantially to Cal Poly Pomona. Their 
contributions have been used primarily to help build state-of-the-art facilities. These facilities have given 
the college the ability to flourish and become one of the nations leading hospitality management programs, 
according to Collins College Dean Andrew Hale Feinstein.

        The Collins College is extremely grateful to Carol and Jim for their pledge at this important time, 
Feinstein said. Our enrollment has grown significantly over the last few years and we are in critical need 
of additional space. This new building will allow us to accommodate our increasing student population, 
develop a graduate program and will showcase our learn-by-doing philosophy. 

        Reinforcing Cal Poly Pomonas polytechnic approach, graduate students under the direction of 
architecture Professor Kip Dickson will participate in the design of the 20,000-square-foot building. 
Preliminary plans for the building include small modular classrooms, a large lecture hall and faculty offices. 
It will be designed with environmental sustainability as a primary objective, and the college hopes to 
pursue LEED  Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design  certification from the U.S. Green Building 
Council.  

        The buildings landscaping will also embrace sustainable design by including usage of edible 
vegetation for use in the Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch. 

        Founded in 1973, The Collins College of Hospitality Management is the first and largest four-year 
hospitality management degree program in California and the only hospitality management college on the 
West Coast. More than 1,000 undergraduate students receive a superior education in the state-of-the-art 
Collins College facilities, where they learn to apply hospitality management theories and concepts to real-
world settings. Part of this unique academic experience includes managing and operating the full-service 
Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch.

          Cal Poly Universities Rose Float Seaside Amusement  
                           Scheduled for Joy Ride to Pasadena

        POMONA, Calif.  Before the Cal Poly Universities 61  Rose Float cruises down Colorado 
Boulevard on New Years Day, it has to make its way from Pomona to Pasadena. If you think driving in Los 
Angeles traffic is tough, try doing it in a 50-foot float!  

        Students from the Cal Poly Universities will be taking their self-built float, Seaside Amusement, 
on its long journey to Brookside Pavilion decoration center in Pasadena on Sunday, Dec. 21 .  

        Because of the floats obvious potential for traffic distraction, it is transported at night. A 
lighthearted christening is scheduled at 8:30 p.m. The four-hour journey from the Cal Poly Pomona Rose 
Float Lab begins at approximately 10 p.m. 

        Local trucking company KKW Performance Transportation is again assisting students in 
transporting the float through streets, highways and byways. The convoy is escorted by a special team of 
officers from the University Police Department to clear a path and ensure safety.  

        The route (available upon request) is carefully chosen to ensure room for the float, which measures 
50-feet long, 18-feet wide and 22-feet high. The float will travel through 11 cities  including Pomona, 
West Covina, Temple City, Arcadia and South Pasadena  before arriving at the Brookside Pavilion 
decoration center near the Rose Bowl Stadium. 
                                           st
         Seaside Amusement is the 61  consecutive entry into the Rose Parade by Cal Poly Pomona and 
San Luis Obispo students. The Cal Poly Universities project is the only Rose Parade float entry designed, 
constructed, decorated and financed entirely by students. From Dec. 22 to Jan. 1, final float preparations, 
decorating and judging take place in Pasadena.  

        The float features a lively and whimsical seaside boardwalk filled with amusement rides and 
attractions, including a roller coaster, Ferris wheel, parachute drop, game, food and ticket booths, carousel 
horses and bumper cars.

        POMONA, Calif.  With the New Year's Day parade fast approaching, its time for Rose Float 
students to put the petals to the metal, so to speak. Students from the Cal Poly Universities in Pomona 
                                                                                                            st
and San Luis Obispo are looking for volunteers to help them add flowers and finishing touches to the 61  
Cal Poly Rose Float parade entry. 

        Decorations Week runs from Dec. 26-31 at the Brookside Pavilion, located near Lot I at the Rose 
Bowl in Pasadena. Shifts of three to five hours can begin as early as 8 a.m. and end as late as midnight. 
Volunteers can assist by preparing the natural materials, decorating the float, working in the food tent for 
volunteers, cleaning up, as well as helping with volunteer check-in.  

        Volunteers who wish to decorate the float do not have to sign up. If they arrive and space is 
available, they will be admitted. However, groups of 10 or more must register in advance online at 
http://www.cpprosefloat.org. Admission into the Brookside Pavilion requires purchase of a $1 wristband. 

        The Cal Poly Universities float is the only entry in the annual Tournament of Roses parade that is 
designed, built, and decorated solely by students and volunteers -- a tradition that dates back to 1949. Each 
year, more than 1,000 community volunteers lend a hand in covering every inch of the float with natural 
materials, such as flowers, leaves, seeds or bark. 
                                                                                      st

                 Cal Poly Pomona Introduces Graduate Program  
                       to Give Accountants a Competitive Edge 
                                                                 th
              Masters in Accountancy is Universitys 24  Graduate Degree Program 
 

        POMONA, Calif.  Graduate programs are often in high demand during periods of recession. 
Joining Cal Poly Pomonas 23 graduate programs is a new advanced degree program that will address the 
in-demand field of accounting.   

        The degree, Master of Science in Accountancy, or MSA, is an important component for accountants 
who want to advance their careers, either as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) or as an accounting 
professor. When classes begin in fall 2009, Cal Poly Pomona will be the fifth CSU in Southern California to 
offer an MSA program.  

        Those who work as accountants and auditors already enjoy being in one of the most in-demand 
career fields in the country. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that accountants will have the 
third most number of job openings from 2006 to 2016.  

        Accountants today, however, cannot solely rely on the information they learned 20, 10, or even five 
years ago.  

        Accounting professionals these days are facing dynamic domestic and international accounting 
issues, said MSA Program Director Dr. Hong Pak. He noted that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the 
upcoming adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission as examples of dramatic changes in accounting standards.

        These issues demand that accounting professionals acquire more advanced accounting concepts, 
Pak said. We are certain that our MSA program will be an important tool in helping them adapt and satisfy 
their clients needs. 

        Also, as the accounting landscape shifts, new opportunities arise. Internal control, corporate 
governance and forensic accounting are just a few examples of relatively new career tracks that have 
witnessed significant growth. In fact, two out of three CPAs said forensic accounting departments have 
been expanded at their firms in the past year, according to a 2008 American Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants survey. The MSA program has integrated such contemporary issues into its curriculum.  

        Those who complete the program will satisfy the requirement to have 150 semester hours in order 
to become a CPA.   

        Although the MSA program is geared toward working professionals, it also assists individuals who 
want to enter a doctoral program in accounting. Currently, there is a high demand for those with Ph.D.s in 
all business disciplines and it is expected that by 2013, the shortage of business Ph.D.s will reach 2,419, 
according to a report from AACSB International, the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. 
Accounting professionals who enter academia can expect to command a high salary compared to faculty 
members of other disciplines.  

        CBA will accept applications through CSU Mentor (www.csumentor.edu) from now until June 15, 
2009. The program is designed for up to 30 students and is primarily geared toward those who have studied 
accounting as an undergraduate student. For more information, go to:

        The College of Business Administration at Cal Poly Pomona offers two other graduate programs: a 
Master of Business Administration degree that allows students to specialize in eight different career tracks
