        
       The College of Engineering has been awarded a software grant by long-time technology 

partner Intergraph Mapping and Geospatial Solutions. Valued at more than $3.4 million, this 

grant will allow the college to expand its geospatial engineering laboratory, research and 

Geographical Information Systems (GIS) curriculum.  

       The grant includes more than 20 products from Intergraph and one of its companies, Z/I 

Imaging. These products will be integrated into Cal Poly Pomonas geospatial engineering 

laboratory and facilitate complete global positioning systems (GPS) data acquisition processing, 

total station data acquisition processing, softcopy photogrammetric data acquisition processing, 

GIS and remote sensing analysis, visualization and animation scene development. 

       Cal Poly Pomona has had a long and fruitful relationship with Intergraph and Z/I 

Imaging, says Howard Turner, professor of surveying and civil engineering. We are grateful 

for the valuable opportunity to incorporate an enormous breadth of technology into our 

curriculum and strengthen our efforts in GIS and softcopy photogrammetry. 

       Photogrammetry and GIS are two of the courses that will use the laboratory for a more 

hands-on study of the geosciences. In addition, a new course elective, Elements of Spatial

           CAL POLY POMONAS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING SERVES AS 
    TIMING & SCORING COMMAND CENTER FOR SOLAR CHALLENGE RACE 
 
       With gasoline prices hovering just below $2 a gallon, a number of college students will 

manage to take a road trip across the country this summer without a drop of gas. These students 

are competing in the American Solar Challenge (ASC) in which solar-powered racecars make a 

2,300-mile expedition from Chicago to Claremont. 

       Throughout the 10-day competition, Cal Poly Pomonas College of Engineering will 

serve as the command center, tracking and scoring entries. Vehicles will be tracked through use 

of a global positioning satellite system.  

       ASC will get underway Sunday, July 13, at the Museum of Science and Industry in 

Chicago and will follow legendary Route 66 through eight states. The race will finish 

Wednesday, July 23, at Yale Avenue in downtown Claremont. 

       The 30 cars in this years competition must rely solely on electric power generated by 

sunlight. With no other external power source permitted, most entries are one-man vehicles with 

futuristic body designs featuring solar cells covering much of the surface. 

       For more information on the competition or for daily race results, visit 

www.americansolarchallenge.org throughout the duration of the event.

     CAL POLY POMONA PROFESSOR WORKS WITH POMONA HIGH SCHOOL 
           TEACHER TO ENHANCE SCIENCE CURRICULUM, EXPERIENCE 
 
       Sonal Patel generally teaches about anatomy and research to his students at Pomona High 
School, but this summer, hes the one conducting the research.  
       Patel is one of only 14 teachers selected nationwide to participate in Frontiers in 
Physiology, a program of the American Physiological Society (APS), in which teachers and 
physiologists work collaboratively to improve science education at middle and high school 
levels. His host is Cal Poly Pomonas Steven Wickler, director of equine research and university 
veterinarian. 
       I think educating science teachers is a critical component of education, Wickler said. 
You have to have teachers interested in science so they can convey the same interest to their 
students. This seemed like a great avenue, so I was interested in hosting. 
       Since May, Patel has worked with Wickler to study the metabolic rates of horse muscles 
at high and low altitudes. Time spent in the labs has reacquainted Patel with research techniques 
and strategies as well as provided new ideas for classroom teaching. 
       Its been like coming back to school again, Patel said. Its a challenge for me, but it 
improves my teaching by leaps and bounds. 
       Since 1990, more than 120 APS members have hosted more than 250 middle and high 
school teachers nationwide. Subsequently, about 250,000 students have benefited from this 
program.  
       Cal Poly Pomona is located at 3801 W. Temple Ave. in Pomona. Daily parking permits 
are required, and can be purchased for $4 at the Visitor Information Booth along Kellogg Drive.

       Although distance could make it difficult to attend a loved ones graduation, Cal Poly 
Pomona made it possible for someone across the globe to join in the festivities.  
       By providing live webcasts and downloads of commencement ceremonies on the Internet, 
the universitys Instructional & Information Technology division has reached audiences across 
the world. In only one week, the universitys ceremonies were viewed 22,296 times from at least 
22 countries including Thailand, Syria, the Philippines and Peru.  
       Its great. Every year were doing better and better, adding features and increasing the 
number of plays, said Imran Hamid, operating systems analyst and streaming engineer. Weve 
only gotten positive feedback. 
       A nine-member team worked nearly 16 hours a day to produce live streaming video of 
the universitys eight commencement ceremonies on June 13-15. The videos could still be 
viewed and downloaded at http://video.csupomona.edu/june2003. 
       The university has provided streaming video of commencement ceremonies since 2001, 
with a steadily increasing audience. This year, staff began integrating titles and credits during 
live webcasts. Due to the success of Cal Poly Pomonas video streaming services, the university 
also supplied video streaming services to its sister campus Cal State Northridge, which held it 
graduation ceremonies one week prior.  
       Beginning next year, the division anticipates the ability to produce high-quality DVD 
copies of the ceremonies. These copies will be available for sale to students families as a 
reminder of their loved ones achievements.

          CAL POLY POMONA CAREER CENTER SERVICES ENHANCED BY  
                  $25,000 DONATION FROM ENTERPRISE RENT-A-CAR 
 
       While Enterprise Rent-A-Car is known for providing its customers a smooth ride from 
point A to point B, a recent donation to Cal Poly Pomonas Career Center will also help students 
make a smooth transition from college to the work force. 
       An Enterprise Rent-A-Car representative presented a check for $5,000 to the universitys 
Career Center on July 21. It is the first installment of a $25,000 pledge to aid Career Center 
support services. 
       Enterprise Rent-A-Car has been a remarkable partner, said Manuel Perez, director of 
the Career Center. They maintain a constant presence at the university, actively meeting with 
our faculty and with members of our student organizations. We are grateful for the relationship 
we have built over the years. 
        Enterprise Rent-A-Car has had a long-standing relationship with the university. The 
company has hired 72 Cal Poly Pomona alumni to work in its Southern California offices. It has 
also provided vans to serve as shuttles during the Career Centers job fairs throughout the year. 
       Its mutually beneficial, said Enterprise Rent-A-Car recruiter Kathy Gillen, who 
presented the check. Gillen noted that it serves the organization well to support the education and 
development of its future employees. 
       The donation will support Career Center service programs such as its computer lab, 
resource library, seminars, workshops and job fairs.

                MCNAIR SCHOLARS PROGRAM SUMMER SYMPOSIUM 
                   WILL SHOWCASE STUDENT RESEARCH PROJECTS 
 
       After six months of graduate-level research, 20 students in Cal Poly Pomonas McNair 
Scholars Program are set to present their findings at a summer symposium on July 31, from 9-
11:25 a.m., in the Bronco Student Center. 
       All of their hard work since January culminates in 15 minutes of fame, said academic 
advisor Joan Hill. 
       The McNair Scholars Program is named for Ronald E. McNair, best known as one of the 
astronauts aboard the 1986 Challenger shuttle. The federally funded program in his name 
encourages first-generation, low-income or underrepresented students to earn doctoral degrees 
through involvement with research, mentors, seminars and financial aid.  
       Physics senior Krista Banks said that she feels prepared for graduate school after going 
through the program. I feel like I know whats expected of me in grad school whereas before I 
would have gone in blindly, she said. 
       Each McNair scholar chose a professor who guided the students research project from 
proposal to final paper. Research topics range from cannabinoid receptors in mice to the effects 
of race on adoption. 
       Were very proud of the McNair Scholars Program at the university, said Frank Torres, 
director of the Cal Poly Pomona program.  In the past four years, it has enriched the lives of 73 
students. This program holds a unique and special place in our lives as well as for the faculty and 
staff who work with our students.
