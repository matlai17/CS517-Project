\f0\fs24 \cf0 U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin urged Kenya to combat corruption and get its economy back on track. \
Rubin said that the reforms from Kenya had slowed down along with its economy. Rubin mentions about how to attract foreign investment by a sound macroeconomic policies, a string financial system, open-markets and good governments. \
He said that to combat corruption and attract investment, Kenya need clear laws and regulations that are easily enforced, honest, well-trained regulators, and judges, and anti-corruption units with real power to crack down on corrupt practices. \
He mentions that privatizing state-owned enterprises also reduces corruption. \
Well-regulated financial systems where credit isn\'92t allocated based on connections and efficient public service also helps preventing corruptions. \
He said that the politics of reform must keep pace with the policies of reform.\
